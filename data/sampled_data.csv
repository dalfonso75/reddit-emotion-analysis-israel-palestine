I figured I would flesh it out here to start some discussion and maybe even challenge my own thinking.

Canada was a country born from settler colonialism, only 100 years earlier than Israel was formed. Europeans hopped on boats, sailed across the world, and started settling North America. When they encountered the Indigenous Peoples, they enslaved them, murdered them, or formed deceptive/unequal alliances with some of them to eridicate other Indigenous Peoples. Over time our villages grew into towns, which grew into cities, and the Indigenous Peoples got violently pushed back into reservations. We set up residential schools and proceeded to remove Indigenous children from their homes so we could educate (and beat/torture) the native out of them. Just this a few years ago we have uncovered close to 1000 graves and remains of Indigenous children on residential school properties. To this day, our Indigenous Peoples suffer from high rates of unemployment, poverty, substance abuse, and suicide. And they are victims of systemic discrimination that CIA and white intelligence communities created to prevent collective identity to be formed (to prevent the First Nations to effectively resist any actions/policies towards them).

All of this sounds a lot like how Israel-haters paint the picture of the Israeli treatment of Palestinians. And yet there is no international outrage against Canada, with people marching through the streets and taking to social media calling Canada an illegitimate settler colonial nation that has engaged in ethnic cleansing of the Indigenous Peoples. Nobody is calling for white Canadians to return the land back to the Indigenous Peoples and go back to Europe. And there is no BDS movement aimed at Canada.

Why is that? What is the difference that justifies the vilification of Israel but not Canada? Why cant people accept the stronger always win; and we get to write the policies. The strong will never allow what they do to others to be done upon them. The first nations in Canada realized this accepted their horrible fate why cannot the palestinaians accept this?

Foreign minister Israel Katz has replaced him and Gideon Sa'ar will replace Katz' role as foreign minister.

Previously, Gallant told a closed-door Knesset committee that Netanyahu’s goal of “absolute victory” in Gaza was “nonsense"" in August and had earlier in 2023 claimed that the war was being conducted ""without a compass"". Gallant voiced strong criticism of Netanyahu’s focus on maintaining Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow stretch along the Gaza-Egypt border. He called this strategy a “moral disgrace,” voting against it in cabinet discussions.

Gallant argued that holding this territory obstructed a potential ceasefire and a chance for a hostage exchange, stressing, “If we want the hostages alive, we’re running out of time.” Relations between Netanyahu and Gallant soured in March 2023, when the Bibi threatened to dismiss him after Gallant spoke out against the government’s proposed judicial overhaul. The legislation aimed to give the ruling coalition greater influence over judicial appointments. Another point of contention has been the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men into the IDF, which Gallant has supported while some far-right cabinet members have resisted the measure.

Netanyahu had come under pressure from far-right cabinet members to remove Gallant, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir stating in September that he had been pushing for Gallant’s dismissal for months, adding, “The time has come to act without delay.”

For the sake of argument, let’s assume that the actions of the resistance, such as kidnapping, were wrong. Why should over 2 million people face torture, killing, rape, and burning?

Why are NICUs and hospitals bombed? Why are the elderly shot by snipers simply because they are older than the occupiers in Palestine? Why have more than 150 scientists and scholars, whose names and credentials I know, been assassinated? Why are mosques and churches bombed? Why are historical sites destroyed? Why have all the universities been obliterated? 

Why are ICU departments targeted? Why has the Israeli army's terrorist force killed 2,100 infants and toddlers under the age of two, out of around 17,000 children in Gaza since the beginning of this genocide?

Why do they murder families, leaving a child alive to suffer alone after forcing him to watch every member of his family getting killed?

On June 21 the [NYT reported on a leaked recording from Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's finance minister](https://archive.ph/GTWSO) revealing a “dramatic” plan to impose permanent Israeli control over the West Bank “without the government being accused of annexing it,” as Smotrich was recorded saying to a group of settler leaders earlier in June. Smotrich’s statements, were recorded by the Peace Now Israeli NGO and published by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/21/middleeast/israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam/index.html) as well.

Smotrich was recorded saying that he had concocted a plan in the past year and a half and exposed it to Netanyahu, who he said was “fully onboard.”

&gt;“I’m telling you, it’s mega-dramatic,” Mr. Smotrich told the settlers. “Such changes change a system’s DNA.”

...

&gt;Israel’s Supreme Court has ruled that Israel’s rule over the territory amounts to a temporary military occupation overseen by army generals, not a permanent civilian annexation administered by Israeli civil servants. Smotrich said that he oversaw the creation of an entire administrative body directly linked to the government and that members of this body were already embedded in the Israeli armys Civil Administration.

...

&gt;In his June 9 speech, he outlined a [carefully orchestrated](https://archive.ph/Q8WTz#selection-5045.327-5053.108) program to take authority over the West Bank out of the hands of the Israeli military and turn it over to civilians working for Smotrich in the defense ministry. Parts of the plan have already been incrementally introduced over the past 18 months, and some authorities have already been transferred to civilians.

...

&gt;“We created a separate civilian system,” Smotrich said. To deflect international scrutiny, the government has allowed the defense ministry to remain involved in the process, he said, so that it seems that the military is still at the heart of West Bank governance.

&gt;“It will be easier to swallow in the international and legal context,” Mr. Smotrich said. “So that they won’t say that we are doing annexation here.” Reporters for The New York Times listened to a recording of the roughly half-hour speech that was provided by one of the attendees, a researcher from Peace Now, an anti-occupation campaign group. A spokesman for Mr. Smotrich, Eytan Fold, confirmed he gave the speech and said the event was not a secret.

&gt;In particular, he pointed to one change under which military officers no longer oversee most of the process by which Israeli settlements are expanded, land is expropriated and roads are built in the West Bank. Those roles are now overseen by “a civilian working under the defense ministry” who does not work for military commanders, he said, but in a new directorate that Mr. Smotrich supervises.

...

&gt;As a lawmaker over the past decade, Mr. Smotrich attracted attention for regularly making extremist comments, including his call to destroy a Palestinian town; his support for segregation between Arabs and Jews in maternity wards; and his backing for Jewish landowners who will not sell property to Arabs. Since late 2022, Mr. Smotrich has gained extraordinary influence over government policy. That is when his party joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, helping it secure a small majority in Parliament.

&gt;Mr. Smotrich used that leverage to persuade Mr. Netanyahu to assign him both the position in the defense ministry as well as the finance ministry, a role that Mr. Smotrich has used to block funds for the Palestinian Authority. “My goal — and I think of everyone here — is to first and foremost prevent the establishment of a terror state in the very heart of the land of Israel,” Mr. Smotrich said in the recorded speech. Mr. Smotrich said his main achievement has been to place many of the military’s duties in the West Bank under civilian control. While the army has often turned a blind eye to settlement expansion and even guards unauthorized settlements from Palestinian attack, soldiers have also sometimes destroyed settler encampments built without government permission and barred Israeli activists from entering the West Bank. To counteract that influence, Mr. Smotrich said, the government has: Given civilians greater control over settlement construction plans as well as oversight over the lawyers who decide legal issues in the settlements. Stripped the army’s top commander in the West Bank of the ability to block settlement construction plans. Secured nearly $270 million from Israel’s defense budget to guard settlements in 2024-2025. Moved closer to establishing a new security squad that could more speedily demolish Palestinian buildings in the West Bank that have been built without Israeli permission.

This comes after Israel's [recent plans to legalize five West Bank settlements](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/30/middleeast/israel-west-bank-settlements-international-condemnation-intl/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc) and [Israel's largest West Bank land seizure since 1993](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/22/israel-largest-west-bank-settlement-blinken-visit/).

Me and other people have covered this topic extensively, and I've especially covered the point of Israel's behavior as a means of trying to deflect international criticism when they try to have their cake and eat it. Previously I've touched on how Gantz' party was taking a lead in the polls against Likud though it was regressing, but recently it seems as though [Likud is once again leading in the polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_Israeli_legislative_election#/media/File:Opinion_polls_Israel_2026.svg). I would say this progress isn't set in stone since elections could turn the tide but it seems like no matter how many times the Israeli right messes up they're just gonna keep getting elected. [I've also covered Miriam Adelson's involvement in demanding a West Bank annexation from Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1d8m8k5/megadonor_miriam_adelson_demands_recognition_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), so as you can see the hopes that moderates might be able to take power following this war is dwindling and Palestinians will, as usual, probably continue receiving the short end of the stick until the next bout of violence erupts.

In less than a year the Rwanda genocide took 800k plus lives. By roving bands of lunatics. 

The Armenian genocide costed 1 million lives in a year. These happened over a larger territorial holdings than the strip.  By ww1 arms in one case.  In rifles and machete like meele weapons in another. I have disputed the idea of genocide since this chaos started.  To be called all sorts of names. I don't mind.  We're we to look at the total fatalities as a percentage of population i don't even think it would qualify. 


The fatalities in Gaza are horrible and a condemnation on all ppl. However they seem more in line to the destruction of total war. My title of this is half ironic. The allegations of genocide has not ended. Yet to a casual observer there is no grounds to that charge. Appearing more in line to the use the alarmist propaganda.  Than an actual genocidal plot. A nation such as Israel to have set out to commit genocide and still not be done with it. Seems to a spurious charge. They can destroy 5 armies across all it's fronts in 6 days. But cannot do this????  


I genually don't understand how this qualifies as genocide? And to my readings it seems like somewhere we conflated the indiscriminate bombings with acts of genocide and called it as such. 

Look. I genuinely believe the People of the strip got a very rotten end of the stick. Suffering from Israel's harsh retribution to the plots of Hamas. And suffering Hamas stupid leadership that knows an end to fighting means an end to their mandate.  I don't know how much Gazans support Hamas. Prior discussions with ppl attempted to separate the identities of GAZA and HAMAs and calling Hamas puppets of Israel. I found those charge spurious and biased given the apparent unwillingness to think Israeli ppls as different from the government or IDF showing bias in that regard. 

Anyway. What are the evidentiary proof of a genocide in Gaza? 

I will grant that the restoration of basic services and aid convoys are to account for ppl reaching out from the strip to ask for help in tik tok. Life always resumes it's course

I'm an atheist outside observer. I'm writing this after watching [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amz2Sf1JMDE) between Mehdi Hasan and Benny Morris. What struck me is the brutal honesty of Morris, and also the way he was heckled and jeered for it. I found his honesty refreshing, and I feel that this kind of moral pile-on only encourages zionists to lie instead. We need to be honest about human nature. There is one irrefutable fact:

**When backed into a corner, the gloves come off**.

International Law? Forget it. Morality? Dont make me laugh. Rape. Torture. Genocide. Anything is on the cards when your existence is threatened. Regardless of how immoral you may consider the creation of Israel to be. This applies all to of us, Isreali or Palestinian or whoever. This is human nature. But we scorn others for this because we dont want to recognize this in ourselves. We dont want to accept that if we were born into these situations, we would also act this way. So we lie. We make excuses. We make moral judgements as if we are above them. We need to be honest about human nature and work within these constraints.

I believe a 2 state solution is possible. Difficult, very very difficult. But possible. So we need to also be honest about why it's difficult before advocating for it.

We should recognise that Israel has horrible borders. They are long and insecure compared to the size of Israel. Handing over the west bank to Palestinians immediately is suicide. But a stable cooperative future between Plaestine and Israel is possible eventually.

Yes, Palestinians have had horrible leadership, and terrible negotiators. Peace slipped through their hands multiple times. But that's not the fault of the future generation. And also consider another human quirk- the gamblers fallacy. When you lose so much, you keep holding on to recoup your losses. It was tough for them to accept their losses. A finalised agreement would legitimise their losses. They instead wanted an incremental solution, with no final final agreement, as every incremental concession from Israel would increase the Palestinian's leverage. Israel, by contrast, wanted a finalised agreement, unwilling to concede it's current leverage. This is human nature. Let's not condemn people for this, because you would do the same. But it's also obvious that the negotiators (Arafat etc) blew it.

Western governments get a lot of flack for supporting Israel, despite their obvious violations of international law. However, consider what would happen if we pulled the plug? Israel would face an even greaterr existential threat. And they have nukes. Things would get more violent, not less. Israel, quite rightly, will never allow itself to be erased. Gloves off.

I believe that a path is possible out of this madness. Neither side wants this. The west doesnt want this. Nobody wants this. But we are all prisoners of human nature, and we need to admit this first before we can chart a course towards a positive future.

I believe that a 2-state solution is possible. Not now, but in future. The only alternative is the continued horrific ethnic cleansing. It will take generations of political stability for the mutual hatred to subside. People need to grow up without losing their family to terrorism or airstrikes. The next generation bear no responsilbility for this mess.

What is achievable pollitcally is governed by the red-lines of popular opinion. Both sides are held hostage to this. Hamas cannot show contrition. Neither can Israel. But do you remember when Palestinians in gaza were celebrating after the false news of a ceasefire deal? People thought for once that Hamas had achieved something positive and were happy. Any demonstration of progress, no matter how small, shifts those red lines and changes what is politically possible. Incremental, mutual demonstrations of good faith will move the red lines and change what is possible. We put men on the moon. We can do this.",It's time to be honest,0.56,17,0,2024-08-31 18:46:48

""Corporation accused of ‘whitewashing that keeps viewers ill-informed about nature of Hamas’""

Apparently through-out the documentary they replaced the word ""Jew"" with ""Israeli forces"" and ""Jihad"" with ""resisting"", such that several references to ""Jihad against Jews"" is replaced with ""resisting Israeli forces"". In one example, an interviewee praising former terrorist-leader Sinwar said that he should be admired for ""fighting Israeli forces"" when they actually said he should be admired for ""Jihad against the Jews"".

This documentary was previously pulled by the BBC when it was discovered that they hid the fact that the narrator was the son of a Hamas official. The BBC is also under pressure to reveal whether any taxpayer money was given to Hamas during the making of the documentary.

BBC's anti-Israel bias is nothing new. Several independent reports commissioned by the BBC and other sources have alleged that the BBC is heavily biased against Israel. Many articles and journalists also accuse the BBC of anti-Israel bias.

For example, the Balen report is a 20,000-word document written by the senior broadcast journalist alleging anti-Israeli bias by the BBC. The Balen report examined hundreds of hours of coverage of Israel/Palestine and compiled evidence of the BBC's bias. As of 2025, BBC refuses to release the report and has spent close to $500,000 to conceal the report.

There is also another report called the Asserson report, which provides similar evidence of ""anti-Israel bias"" at the BBC.",BBC removed references to ‘Jews’ and ‘jihad’ in controversial Gaza documentary in an attempt to whitewash comments about Hamas,0.91,233,0,2025-02-26 20:19:19

Realistically, moving back over 5 million palestinian refugees would not be possible given the size of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. There simply wouldn't be enough land available for 5 million more people, I mean Israel's entire population at the time was 7 million.

There were attempts to overcome this such as proposals to allow refugees the right to return in Israel proper but the palestinians requested 150,000 every year. Israel is right to be concerned that demographically this would lead to the state changing from a jewish state to a multinational state.

I acknowledge the counter arguments regarding justice but a right of return would mean the end of Israel and palestinians know this. It's not worth giving up on peace because of this. I mean look at the current crisis which could have been wholly avoided especially in Gaza.

Also from the article (linked in comments):

Haaretz published an analysis by Yagil Levy, a sociology professor at the Open University of Israel, which found that in three earlier campaigns in Gaza, in the period from 2012-22, the ratio of civilian deaths to the total of those killed in airstrikes hovered at about 40%. That ratio declined to 33% in a bombing campaign earlier this year, called Operation Shield and Arrow.In the first three weeks of the current operation, Swords of Iron, the civilian proportion of total deaths rose to 61%, in what Levy described as “unprecedented killing” for Israeli forces in Gaza. The ratio is significantly higher than the average civilian toll in all the conflicts around the world during the 20th century, in which civilians accounted for about half the dead, according to Levy.**“The broad conclusion is that extensive killing of civilians not only contributes nothing to Israel’s security, but that it also contains the foundations for further undermining it,”** Levy concluded. “The Gazans who will emerge from the ruins of their homes and the loss of their families will seek revenge that no security arrangements will be able to withstand.”","Civilians make up 61% of Gaza deaths from airstrikes, Israeli study finds",0.62,39,0,2023-12-10 09:45:24

UNIFIL has been a complete and utter failure. An embarrassment in fact. How the UN can even keep a straight face when they talk about peacekeeping is the true eighth wonder of the modern world. They had only one job under Resolution 1701 and that was to disarm Hezbollah and secure the south of Lebanon (Israel already abided by its obligations under 1701).

""I don't support Hamas, but...""
""Hamas is just resisting occupiers""

There are a lot of Pro Palestinians who aren't that fervent in opposing Hamas. This is the cause of many issues in the conflict.

Hamas is violent to Jews, so Jews increase security to stop Hamas being violent, so Hamas is more violent to Jews, so Jews increase security to stop Hamas, so opportunistic Palestinians create a violent group to kill Jews, so opportunistic settlers take more Palestinian land. It's an endless cycle of vengeance and retaliation.

If you want to stop that, simply demanding that the IDF stop occupation or Israel stop being an apartheid state isn't gonna do anything. The UN has no army, they can't stop Israel. Arab countries don't care enough about Palestine to do much in it. Palestinians are not in a strong position right now. If you stop the USA sending money to Israel, they'll stop using bombs as much and use cheap indiscriminate artillery. 

The only real option to stop the cycle is to seriously oppose Hamas. That means not promoting Pro Hamas news articles, opposing any talk of ""It's just resisting colonization"" it means opposing throwing rocks at soldiers. Violent resistance isn't working, and just makes things much worse. You need to self police your communities to avoid any hint of violence so that the cycle can end.

Israelis have taken the first step repeatedly. In 1949, they offered a very generous peace proposal and right of return for many, and were shot down. In 1967 they offered a generous peace proposal, and were not recognized. In 1993 they offered the Oslo accords, and got a massive increase in terrorism. In 2000 they offered Camp David, and got refused and got a massive increase in terrorism. The Palestinians rejected 2008 peace proposals because they hoped for the next government to offer more, and then rejected 2014 because it didn't offer enough concessions.

Israelis aren't gonna take the first step, and you have no way to force them to take the first step to peace. The best way to stop the violence is to end the violence on the Pro Palestinian side first. That can stop the cycle and create a safe and happy Palestine.",Pro-Palestinians need to take the first step to ensure peace,0.64,32,0,2023-12-19 15:25:55
k8u1nrp,1,"&gt;It doesn’t change the fact the the purpose of Israel is to have a place for Jews to flee to if they needed it.

Again, why do jews have a place, while palestinians don't?

If u say to me that palestinians can go to other Arab countries, then, ur grandparents can also go back to where they came from. There's no right for Jews over the land, yet, since it's now the 3rd generation of jews in Israel, they can't just leave, they have the right to stay!!

 Similar to what happened, in South Africa, many generations of White people lived there, and after Nilson Mandilla came to power he granted white and black people similar rights. He put an end to the apartheid system, and prosecuted all of those who contributed to it.

In a similar manner the solution should be that every Israeli who contributed to the genocide or apartheid system enforced by Israel in the past 75 years, must be prosecuted. Israelis and palestinians must be granted the same rights. The apartheid system must stop. Then, Palestinians and jews can live together on that land side-by-side.

The ideology that Jews have the right to be safe in the land, while Palestinians can f off, is the root cause of Hamas.",IsraelPalestine,2023-11-11 20:34:27,17s61yc,yousef-dawood,0,1,0,True,2023-09-27 03:32:19,0.0,0.0,1.0,-58.0,-57.0,191,"Palestinians have been promised by their leaders that the resistance will not stop until the right of return for all refugees is granted. This is a cornerstone of their negotiating position. Never mind the fact that Palestinians are the only group in history where the refugee label includes all descendants, which makes the right of return a non-starter from the Israeli perspective. A 35-year old American doctor, born and raised in California, is considered a refugee if his Palestinian grandparent was one. No other refugee group is granted this broadening definition.

The belief in a full right of return was behind the Palestinians rejecting peace offers in 2000 and 2008. 

The Israeli offer in 2000 tried to address the right of return with this offer:

""In the Israeli proposal, a maximum of 100,000 refugees would be allowed to return to Israel on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification. All other people classified as Palestinian refugees would be settled in their present place of inhabitance, the Palestinian state, or third-party countries. Israel would help fund their resettlement and absorption. An international fund of $30 billion would be set up, which Israel would help contribute to, along with other countries, that would register claims for compensation of property lost by Palestinian refugees and make payments within the limits of its resources""

It was rejected.

The other day I saw video of palestinian teenagers holding decades-old keys to houses/apartments that no longer even exist, proclaiming that 'these are the keys of our grandparents, and we will return!""

The longer the Palestinian people are duped into thinking a full right of return is possible, the longer we'll go without a Palestinian state.

Throughout history, those who lose wars (especially wars they start) must make compromises to start anew and move forward. Unfortunately for the Palestinian side, they refuse to make necessary compromises for a state to actually come to be. Eventually, people need to move on from the past and deal with present-day realities.

The ICJ specifically is dealing with 2 questions. One of them being Israel's supposed ""Genocide"" (Which has the population of the victims rising during it even according to Hamas's own data, such a lousy job by the IDF) and the other being Israel's occupation of the former Jordanian territory also known as the West Bank (Because it's not like October 7 showed exactly what happens when Israel retreats from a Palestinian territory, right?).

So anyway, you would expect the corrupted clownish UN to at least try and appear unbiased in their ruling, so that their conclusions will actually be believable to anyone who is not a hateful anti-Israeli zombie. Yet it appears they even stopped bothering with that.

Just when Israel was declared war on and while it is still under attack by about 5 different fronts, the ICJ has decided to go ahead and proceed with it's trials over Israel's conduct, while magically electing a new very specific head of court just in time for these proceedings.

This new head of the court is a Lebanese man. Which is already problematic because Lebanon is currently at war with Israel and raises suspicion of bias. But as if that's not enough, this man has a rich history of anti-Israeli and pro-Iranian rhetoric, votes and decisions. Below is some of it.

#Anti Israeli bias:

* During his time as Lebanon’s representative to the UN, Salam voted to condemn Israel 210 times.
These resolutions contained one-sided denunciations of Israel, and gave a free pass to Hamas. For example, in December 2008, Salam voted for a resolution that accused Israel of “acts of terror, provocation, incitement and destruction” against Palestinians, yet made no mention of Hamas or Islamic Jihad.


* Another resolution that Nawaf supported, in 2017, accused Israel of “systematic violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people,” and “causing death and injury to Palestinian civilians, including children, women and non-violent, peaceful demonstrators.”

* In his speeches to the UN, Salam also made many inflammatory statements that demonstrate extreme bias against Israel. In January 2008, Salam accused “terrorist Jewish organizations” of committing “massacres.” He also said that Gaza was an “open air prison.”

* In a November 2008 UN speech, Salam said the “supreme Zionist leadership” pursued a plan of “ethnic cleansing” through “terrorism and organized massacres.”

* In November 2009, Salam told the UN General Assembly that “for too long [Israel’s] war criminals have benefited from impunity”; and Israel was guilty of “flagrant disrespect for international law.”

* In 2011, he accused Israel of “illegitimate actions.”

* On June 13, 2014, Salam accused Israel of “crimes against humanity” and “war crimes.”

* On June 18, 2014, Salam opposed the candidacy of Israel to the vice-presidency of the General Assembly’s Fourth Committee, on the grounds that it is “the most condemned country” at the General Assembly and that it continues to “violate the rules of the international community.” Salam said that Israel was not eligible for election “to any office” at the UN.

* On numerous occasions, including November 2016, Salam has accused Israel of “apartheid.”

* Salam has also repeatedly attacked Israel on social media. In 2015, on Twitter he called Israel a “Triumph of blatant racist &amp; colonialist choices.”
In 2016, in reference to the 2006 war launched by Hezbollah, Salam accused Israel of using “the most vicious &amp; disgusting weapons of all times.” He never once condemned Hezbollah for launching the war, or for attacking Israeli civilians with thousands of rockets. On the contrary, Salam inverted the cause of the war, writing falsely that it was Israel that “launched a 33 day war against my country…”

#Salam's hatred of human rights and support of dictatorships:

* Salam consistently sided with the Islamic Republic of Iran. He voted against all 11 General Assembly resolutions during his tenure that condemned the Iranian regime’s violations against its people.

* In 2007, Salam voted against a UN resolution calling for the release of political prisoners in Belarus. In doing so, he joined a small minority that included China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, Syria and North Korea.

* As civil war was breaking out in Syria in April 2011, Salam used his seat on the Security Council to block a collective press statement from the council that would have condemned the Syrian regime for attacking civilian protesters. Salam expressed support for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s “reforms.”
* In October 2011, Salam abstained on a Security Council resolution that would have condemned Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters. The abstention provoked Lebanese politicians to call for Salam’s resignation.

* Salam subsequently refused to support seven UN General Assembly resolutions that condemned the Assad regime for atrocities against civilians, instead voting to abstain.

* Salam posted on social media his praise for mass murderer Fidel Castro, writing that he was the Cuban dictator was an “icon of rebellion and resistance.”

#Now even if you think Israel is the literal devil on Earth, how is it possible to have a trial when the judge has already determined the outcome of before it started?

This is a very simple statement that any honest man on any side of the political argument should agree with.

Having Israel on trial with a judge that has already showed he supports Israel's enemies and has decided it's already guilty is just another, newer and updated [Dreyfus affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair). The very idea that the world should accept the conclusions of such a ~~court~~ circus is ridiculous, and their conclusions are well known in advance.

But most anti-Israel arguments rely on the assumption that all of Israel's actions must be because of some sinister motive. Israel is never given the benefit of the doubt, being held to extreme scrutiny that we do not apply to any other nation.

Claims of genocide, collective punishment, and a desire to reclaim Gaza can only be substantiated by ignoring mountains of contrary evidence in favor of an assumption that all of Israel's actions must have some sort of evil motivation behind them. This is straight-up perpetuating blood libel, as we all know the reason there's a double standard with Israel that no other country has.

Honing in on this highly controversial, highly inflammatory language distracts from the tangible issues at hand and only serves to polarize us. We all want the same thing (peace). We all (for the most part) condemn the same things (targeting civilians, settler expansion in the West Bank, settler violence that isn't punished harshly enough, far-right extremist governments). But using inflammatory language to describe Israel as a whole alienates Jewish allies who know that this language radicalizes people and would prefer not to contribute to the incitement of violence against Jews worldwide.

And the results are coming in, exactly as expected. With initially many powerful countries staying silent and hesitant about the warrants such as Germany, France, Italy, even Britain unexpectedly to some degree. With some outright rejecting them such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, Argentina, and of course the US. Recently joined by Poland as well and now, we are seeing the US advancing legislation and sanctions on the ICC.

Article: https://www.jpost.com/american-politics/article-836908

&gt;The bill seeking sanctions against members of the International Criminal Court over its issuing of arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant passed 243-140 in the Republican-led House of Representatives on Thursday, marking the body’s second vote in favor of the legislation.

&gt;The “Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,” reintroduced this week by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), received overwhelming Republican support.

&gt;Roy attacked the International Criminal Court’s “unprecedented action of issuing arrest warrants” for the sitting prime minister and former defense minister of Israel.

...

&gt;“If you’re boosting the morale of Hamas, you are on the other team. And in November, the ICC’s Trial Chamber approved the arrest warrants,” Mast added. “We have to pass this bill today to prevent this travesty from moving any further and to deter any more illegitimate actions by this kangaroo court to halt or stall the military success of our allies trying to bring hostages home, both American and Israeli and others.”

...

&gt;He said the ICC has continually abused its authority and demonstrated blatant hostility toward US allies and American values as Israel has “continued to defend itself against terrorists in the Middle East over the injections of this administration.”

...

&gt;“It’s a sham, and its officials need to find real jobs. They have no authority to target Americans or our allies, especially Israel, and we won’t stand for it, Mr. Speaker,” he said. “I look forward to passing this bill, and encouraging the Senate to pass it in time for President[-elect Donald] Trump to sign it on day one.”

Was it worth it? Do you comprehend the impact of such strong action from the US will have on other nations in regards to the ICC?

Is attacking Israel in a useless and delusional attempt to harm it worth shaking the very attempt of humanity to avoid the worse kind of crimes?

Is the erosion and upcoming ignoring of countries going to war of the ICC's jurisdiction and accusations, and all the misery and violence and death that will come instead something you wanted?

Do you really think Netanyahu will be arrested? Do you think this will ""Free Palestine""?

For many, I'm sure all this doesn't matter compared to hardly scratching Israel's reputation.

In no-time Israel will be a hundred years old. Holding one of the world's most powerful passports, enjoying some of the best GDP per capita, holding peace despite tensions with neighbors, and being accepted more and more by the Arab world. Something that was unthinkable just a decade ago.

At what point will logic win over Jew hatred? At what point will you look into the Palestinians, the ones who keep refusing having peace with the indigenous people of the land, and instead chose to declare yet another war, inflicting unspeakable horrors hardly seen in the modern age by any other force but the likes of ISIS. Beheading, burning people alive, torture, the kidnapping of literal babies and so much more. Who can do that aside from actual monsters?

I am betting you will never stop. After all, Jew hatred is ancient. And blaming Jews of the worse crimes that exist is just what the world does (""GeNoCiDe"") for thousands of years at this point. And this exactly is the reason Zionism exists, with every action of yours proving to all the Jews in the world just how important it is.","You did it ""Anti-Zionists"", we are witnessing the collapse of an important international institution, in the name of Jew hatred",0.58,59,0,2025-01-09 21:21:00

Itamar Ben-Gvir is no better.

He’s propping up these extremists to keep his fragile coalition together. By doing so, he’s legitimizing policies that ensure the continued subjugation of Palestinians and the erosion of democracy in Israel.

Other figures, like Aryeh Deri and Avigdor Lieberman, are piling on with their own toxic rhetoric. Deri’s calls to limit the rights of non-Jewish citizens and Lieberman’s suggestion that disloyal Arab citizens should lose their citizenship are straight-up authoritarian and dangerous.

Now onto the actual discussion:  
What is apartheid?

The various conventions and statues concerning the crime of apartheid vary in terms of language but they all agree on three features all apartheid regimes have.

1. An institutionalized regime of systemic racial oppression and discrimination.
2. The regime must have been founded with the intent to maintain the domination of one racial group over another.
3. The regime must feature inhumane and inhuman acts committed as an integral part of the regime.

I think we can all agree to this definition, now let's proceed.  


A common defense against Israel being an apartheid state is: ""1\\5th of Israel citizens are Palestinian--and these citizens can vote and hold office, they enjoy all the same freedoms as their Jewish-Israeli neighbors therefore Israel is not a apartheid state.""

Ignoring the Palestinians living in Israeli occupied lands, let's talk about how Israel treats the two million living in Israel proper.

In 1948, 750,000 Arabs vanished from what is now the state of Israel, for argument's sake let's pretend they weren't expelled and left on their own. With all of these Palestinians gone, Israel begins a systematic  of destruction Palestinian homes through demolition and forestation (the planting of tree in villages making them uninhabitable) Haaertz reported on this process using declassified Israeli documents here: [https://www.haaretz.com/2019-05-27/ty-article/.premium/israel-lifted-military-rule-over-arabs-in-1966-only-after-ensuring-they-couldnt-ret/0000017f-e0fd-d804-ad7f-f1ff86630000](https://www.haaretz.com/2019-05-27/ty-article/.premium/israel-lifted-military-rule-over-arabs-in-1966-only-after-ensuring-they-couldnt-ret/0000017f-e0fd-d804-ad7f-f1ff86630000)

The destruction of the homes ensured that the Palestinians had no place to return to (even if we assume the Palestinians left on their own by destroying their homes Israel still forced displaced them under International Law but let's all ignore that.)

An example of how this all looked let's use the example of the northern village of Iqrit, the people living there  were ordered to leave their village by the Israeli military, and the Iqrit people relocated to another village but were never allowed to return to their home. Eventually the Iqrit people sued for the right to return, and the Supreme Court ruled in their favor but the Israeli Ministry of Defense refused to implement the decision fearing it would create a precedent for the return of other Palestinians forced out. And in 1951 the Ministry of Defense blew up all remaining homes in Iqrit.

In 1950s the state of Israel passed the Absentee Property Law which the state used to claim all the land of all the Palestinians who had fled their homes because of the war regardless of whether they were internally or externally displaced and to this day they are still prohibited from accessing and using the lands or property which belonged to their family in 1948.

And in the first 16 years of Israel's existence Palestinians living within Israel's borders living in its borders were placed under military rule and the state used emergency powers to confiscate properties and close entire villages relegating the Palestinians to dozens of enclaves which they required permits to leave.

Israel banned protests and political parties and Palestinians were tried in military courts instead of regular courts.

According to Haaertz using information from declassified Israeli documents:

&gt;Israel lifted its military rule over the state's Arab community in 1966 only after ascertaining that its members could not return to the villages they had fled or been expelled from \[...\]

By the time military rule was lifted Israel had already completed its initiative of destroying Palestinians homes and making them unlivable.

Today Arabs control just 3% of state land despite making up 20% of the population. The 90% of Palestinians who live in these areas experience higher rates of poverty, lower levels of labor force participation, educational attainment and health than Jewish Israelis.

50% of the Arab population lives below the poverty line!

Only 2% of industrial zones in Israel which generate a significant tax income are located in these Palestinian areas.

The other 10% of Palestinians live in so-called ""mixed cities"" but even then are usually relegated to separate neighborhoods.

""But why don't they move?"" you may ask. Well, because unlike most industrialized countries Israel controls 93% of the land either directly or indirectly through quasi-national bodies such as the Jewish National Fund. And in 2011 the Knesset passed the ""Communities Acceptance Law"" which established admissions committees in Jewish communities to screen applicants based on their ""social suitability"" or ""the candidate's lack of compatibility with the social-cultural fabric of the community."" As you can imagine this vague wording allows for much discrimination primarily against Arabs (but also against Mizrahi Jews and Ethiopian Israelis or really anyone the residents of the privileged communities fear will lower the value of their homes.)

The law stipulated that admission councils were limited to villages with four-hundred residents though this rule was repeatedly broken and in 2023 the law was expanded to towns with a thousand residents.

Today admissions committees operate in 53 Regional Councils which control 81% of state land in Israel meaning Arab are, in practice, bared from leasing land in 80% of Israel.

For more than fifteen years the residents of Umm al-Hiran have been waging a legal battle to save their village which is scheduled for demolition. Israeli forces attempted to forcibly evacuate the village and began destroying homes however they had to pause the incident due to a scandal where they killed a man named Yakub Abu Alan and then tried to suppress evidence, but the plan has been resumed since 2022.

In the place of Umm al-Hiran will be a new village called Hiran. Hiran's cooperative association bylaws states:

&gt;""An individual may be approved by the admission's committee and become a member of the Hiran cooperative association if they meet the following qualifications: a Jewish Israeli citizen or permanent resident of Israel who observes the Torah and commandments according to Orthodox Jewish values.""

A similar fate awaits the people who live in the thousands of homes of South Israel which are being demolished every year.

Home demolitions don't just occur in the West Bank but Israel proper as well, and attempts to challenge these laws and uphold Palestinian rights are met with further difficulties as in Israel political parties are illegal if they *deny the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state* (under the 1992 law on political parties.)

Under the 1958 Knesset Basic Law any political candidate can be disqualified for:

&gt;Negation of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people.

In Israel BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) is out of the question, and though not criminal to call for a boycott under the 2011 boycott law you are legally open to civil suits and sanctions. 

Also in 2011 the Knesset approved ""Fundamental of Finance Amendment Number 40"" which has been called the ""Nakba Law"" and under this law the state can withhold funding for government institutions that commemorate the Nakba.

Further limitations on Free Speech can be found in the Knesset's rules of procedures which states:

&gt;The Knesset Presidium shall not approve a bill that in its opinion *denies the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish People*, or is racist in its essence.

This makes it so Palestinian lawmakers cannot challenge laws that codify Jewish Israeli domination over the Palestinian minority.

Further barriers for political representation have been made aside from the suppression of Free Speech. In 2014, the Knesset raised the electoral threshold which means the percentage of votes needed for parliamentary representation raised from 2% to 3.25% this spurred a condemnation by the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination saying:

&gt;\[The move\] would considerably weaken the right to political participation of non-Jewish minorities.

According to Jerusalem based Human Rights group B'Tselem Palestinian rights to political participation is under *constant attack!*

During the 2019 elections Benjamin Netanyahu's party provided activists 1,200 cameras only in Arab communities. This move was clearly designed to intimidate voters according to Jamil Baransi, deputy mayor of Reineh.

After the election, the PR firm behind the operation boasted on FaceBook about dropping voter turnout to under 50%, the lowest seen in recent years. And the head of the PR firm had previously said: ""Arabs are sitting alone in the polling stations, we don't trust them. We let them vote in our country even though it's our country, they should at least vote truthfully.""

Palestinian-Israeli citizens political history is fraught with violence, especially during the Second Intifada, the violent crackdown by Israeli forces was *not* limited to the occupied territories in fact 13 Palestinians were killed in Israel proper and over 1,000 arrested.

Disparities in justice also prevail with Palestinians often being put in pre-trial detention while Israeli Jews get bail.

Desmond Tutu the South African bishop who earned a noble prize due to their anti-apartheid activism wrote in 2014:

&gt;I know firsthand that Israel has created an apartheid reality within its borders and through its occupation. The parallels to my own beloved South Africa are painfully stark indeed.

In 2022, Michael Lynk the then Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories concluded in a report that Israel was practicing apartheid. In its list of inhumane and inhuman acts committed as part of the regime was the Citizenship Law which restricts Palestinian Israeli from marrying individuals from the West Ban and Gaza, *this does not apply to Israeli Jews.*

The list also discusses the torture practiced in Israel (methods include: Sleep deprivation, beating and slapping, humiliation, unhygienic conditions, and extended shackling in contorted positions.)

Seven prisons in Israel were found to commit grueling torture by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. And here's an excerpt from Amnesty International's report on apartheid in Israel:

&gt;Amnesty International has examined specifically the inhumane acts of forcibly transfer, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic freedoms or persecution committed against the Palestinian population in Israel and the \[Occupied Palestinian Territories.\]

Here's an excerpt from the Human Rights Watch's report:

&gt;Sepretely from the inhumane acts carried out in the \[Occupied Palestinian Territories,\] the Israeli government has carried out abuse against Palestinians within Israel, including:  
-Refusing to allow Palestinians access to the millions of dunams of land that were confiscated from them.  
-Not permitting more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948 and their descendants to return to Israel.  
-Restricting legal residency in ways that block many Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel.

As a result of that third part tens of thousands of families have been unable to live together, according to Amnesty International, this is profoundly discriminatory.

Supposedly this is for security reasons, but when this law was enacted in 2003 the then Interior Minister Avraham Poraz explained:

&gt;A decision was reached at the time that for now, family unification would cease as it was felt it would be exploited to achieve a creeping right of return \[...\] That is, tens of thousands of Palestinian Arabs are coming into Israel.

B'Tselem in its list of ways in which Israel advances Jewish supremacy includes immigration noting that while any Jew in the world and his or her children, grandchildren and spouses are entitled to immigrate to Israel at any time and receive citizenship, Palestinians living in other countries can not even if they, their parents, or grandparents lived their. They added: ""Taking over land for Jews while crowding Palestinians in enclaves"" stating that Israel ""practices a policy of 'Judazing' the area, based on the mindset that land is a resource based almost exclusively to benefit the Jewish public.""

Indeed the current transportation minister even publicly used this language: ""I intend to Judaize the Galilee"" (https://www.palestinechronicle.com/israeli-transportation-minister-i-intend-to-judaize-the-galilee/)

Israel uses the land it takes to build hundreds of communities for its Jewish citizens but not one for its Palestinian citizens. B'Tselem concluded in their report on Israeli apartheid:

&gt;Israel demographically engineers the space through laws and orders that allow any Jew in the world or their relatives Israeli citizenship but almost completely deny the Palestinians this opportunity.

A regime that uses laws, practices, and organized violence to cement the supremacy of one group over another is an apartheid regime.

And let's remember the Palestinians living in Israel have it best. The situation becomes worse in terms of quality of life and human rights in the following order: East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and without a doubt Gaza.

As Amnesty International's report says:

&gt;The very existence of these separate legal regimes, however, is one of the main tools through which Israel fragments Palestinians and enforces its system of oppression and domination.

As a 2017 UN report on Israeli apartheid puts it the different legal rights afforded to different sectors ""serve to enfeeble opposition to \[apartheid\] and to veil its very existence.""

The same report refers to Palestinians in Israel as ""Domain 1"" which serves: ""To sustain the myth that one portion of the Palestinian people enjoys the full benefits of democracy"" as the report puts it.

If the Palestinians who live in Israel themselves are relegated to second-class citizenship and abused and persecuted against one can only imagine how bad the situation is in all the other domains (East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza.) Zionists may argue that the living conditions of occupied territory is not Israel's responsibility even though Israel's Supreme Court has ruled itself that the West Bank is ""held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The long arm of the state in the area is the military commander."" (That's from the court case Mara'abe v. The Prime Minister of Israel.)

Gaza is also not free from Israeli control, according to the UN it enforces a ""medieval military blockade"" with Israel controlling imports, exports, export taxes and Gaza's territorial waters and airspace and has blocked the building of an airport and seaport. Furthermore Israel controls electricity lines in Gaza and the underwater cable phone calls are placed on, the network that provides the internet, and the frequencies assigned to Palestinian cell phone companies. (From the Human Rights Watch report.)

There's a reason the Human Rights Watch, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN, and Israel's leading expert on international law Professor Yoram Dinstein of Tel Aviv University have all concluded that Gaza is occupied by Israel and thus responsible for its population.

Israel has failed considerably at looking after the wellbeing of its Gazan population with Michael Lynk reporting in 2022 that Gaza had undergone a multi-decade process of de-development and deindustrialization resulting in a 45% unemployment rate and a 60% poverty rate with 80% of the population dependent on *international* assistance.

As B'Tselem concludes: ""Israel has continued to control nearly every aspect of life in Gaza from outside."" But none of the Palestinians living in these lands that Israel controls can vote in elections, they have no political rights. A Israeli Jew can live with full citizenship and benefits in the West Bank while a Palestinian doesn't have citizenship.

Israeli Jews go to civil court, Palestinians go to military court and face a over 99.74% conviction rate.

Hundreds of Palestinians are held without any charges at all and can be held indefinitely.

Political and legal rights differ depending on race in Israel.

Israel is unequal.

Palestinian political parties and demonstrations are illegal.

Palestinians in the West Bank are governed by more than eighteen-hundred military orders pertaining to taxation, transportation, land planning and zoning, natural resources, including water. Israel controls all the water going into occupied territories.

In Gaza, before Oct. 7th, OCHA found that 97% of the water was already found unfit for human consumption and the equipment with which to treat the water was banned by the strict blockade of the strip. Gaza was already suffering from a water crisis. 

The Oslo agreement stipulated that 80% of water in the West Bank would be diverted for Israeli use despite the fact the Israeli population numbers around 100,000 and the Palestinian population numbers around one million. Oslo provided Israelis with a unlimited water supply while Palestinians were restricted to a pre-determined amount, West Bank residents will attempt to supplement their water on their own but the military prevents from  building water insulations without getting a virtually unobtainable permit from the army. They aren't even allowed to deepen pre-existing wells and are denied access to the Jordan River and freshwater springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water through in most of the West Bank, the military destroys rain water harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities often, that's just terrible.

Palestinians in the West Bank are routinely murdered by soldiers and civilians alike with impunity according to Michael Lynk UN Report.

Palestinians have further have been relegated to 165 ""islands"" disconnected from each other by arbitrary roadblocks which restrict freedom of movement.

Palestinians aren't allowed to build homes, they require virtually impossible to acquire permits according to Amnesty International and even if Palestinians do manage to build homes Israeli forces bulldoze them. 

These realities made Michael Lynk imply that what is happening in Israel is worse than what was happening in South Africa.

I leave with this quote from Human Rights Watch:

Every time I delve into this war subject I become stressed out, because it really brings out my biggest insecurity: being hated.

For some background: I'm an Israeli in my mid 20s, I live near the Judea and Samaria area but not in it, with my family. I was born and raised here. I served a mandatory 2 years and 8 months in the army successfully, in a non-combat duty, A.K.A. I didn't hurt/kill anyone as a part of my job.

I struggle with being hated. For me, being hated/disliked/scolded at automatically makes me feel like I'm ""wrong"", even if I did nothing wrong or what I did was nothing crazy. Ofc I do make many mistakes in life, we all do.

My personal problem is that I just feel like people hate me for no control of my own. Some people genuinely believe I am a ""child of the devil"" bc I'm Israeli.

Now I'm not really the type of person to go out of my way to instigate arguments. If someone says something loud enough, I'd rather agree with them, which is a blessing and a curse. So imagine the struggle I sometimes have with talking with people who VERY STRONGLY feels about one side or the other.

The problem for me with this whole conflict is just how damn sensitive it seems to be for everyone. There are A LOT of wars, genocides, and human crises in the world don't get me wrong, but never before have I seen one where people treat it with a level of sensitivity to THIS degree. It feels like humanity is mass programmed to actively root for one and believe that it is the only correct side, while the other side is at best, very confused brainwashed people, or at worst, pure irredeemable evil with the only solution is to ""get rid of them"".

And there's so much fake news and misunderstandings as well. Antisemetism, Islamophobia, East vs. West, prejudices, etc'. This conflict was accidentally made to be the conflictiest conflict possible. It really feels like the epitome of every bad human trait that exist sometimes. It has it all.

Now, do I think there's an actual genocide going on? Like I said, I don't know. I'd LOVE to believe there isn't, bc committing genocide is very bad, but when the two sides are so eagerly sure they're right, with what seems like countless contradicting proof and statements, I'm just at a loss for words.

I want this war to be over. I want Israelis and Palestinians to stop fighting somehow and have actual peace (ik it's not really possible atm). I want to one day wake up and not feel like a huge chunk of the world hates me bc I was born and raised in the wrong place. If anyone out there whether Israeli, Palestinian, or a (non racist) supporter of any of the sides feels the same, I feel you. You're not alone.

&gt;I do want to clarify, Jews and Canaanites lived together peacefully

Its complicated. This statement assumes there was a 'Jewish' identity at the time of the Canaanite culture(s), but there wasn't. What is recognizably Jewish, *arguably*, only emerged during the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BCE, when the Babylonian empire conquered Judea and deported *Judean* elites to Babylon. These Judean elites, after their return to the Levant under the Persian empire, would henceforth establish a Jewish polity that, for the large part, would be a part of wider empires - with the exception of the briefly autonomous Hasmonean dynasty - until its destruction under the Romans in the 1st century AD. This final blow would lead to the scattering of the Jewish into a persecuted minority diaspora. 

So what happened before the 6th century BCE? What was the Jewish, or precursors to Jewish, identity? Judea used to have a sister polity known as Samaria. Both Judea and Samaria were *supposedly* part of a wider 'united monarchy' called the Kingdom of Israel in the 11th - 10th centuries BCE. Samaria was conquered and destroyed by the Assyrian empire in 720 BCE, leaving Judea the sole 'continuation' of what was the Israelites.

Going back further, to roughly the 15th - 10th century BCE, these *Israelites*, long before they coalesced into an independent state, emerged from Canaanite culture. *They were Canaanites themselves*. But eventually what would later become Israelites started developing their own distinct culture compared to surrounding polities. There are archaeological evidences for this, but I'd like to cite the textual one: the Hebrew Scriptures often hints that Israel's surrounding countries had a previously shared culture: Edom is claimed to have descended from Esau. Esau was the brother of Jacob, and both were grandsons of Abraham, the biblical progenitor of the Jewish people.

The conflict between Israeli and Palestinian has been continuing for decades with both parties experiencing very many struggles. To achieve solutions to these conflicts and achieve lasting peace with justice in the Middle East, it requires respect of the rights for both the Israelis and the Palestinians.

For most Israelis, these are the fundamental and main priorities: security and the ability to live in a state recognized internationally. They have political and cultural rights which entail them to have a share in the use of the land. Understanding and ensuring the security of Israel calls for recognition of its ability to exercise defense for the Israeli people and protection from any threats.

This is equally true for the Palestinians and their fight for their state, their liberty and their identity. They should be allowed to rightfully govern their land and avoid any form of invasion or occupation. Recognition of this right implies respect of their desire of a reasonable state of their own and the state of Israel.

They, therefore, realized that there was no other way to secure and maintain peace other than to recognize each other and engage in negotiations without having to depend on the English. For the conflict to reach a solution, both parties should be h2 ready to negotiate and compromise. The members of the international community should also stay involved in such efforts helping to realize the rights of non-Palestinian population and further the future of Israeli and Palestinian people as free and happy nations.

In this way, we need to unite to demand a fair and humane outcome that will provide the two people with the rights and opportunities for freedom. The people, cultures, and religions show that the path to ending violence, murdering, and terrorism is through collaboration and realizing of a common goal of good life. ❤️",Path to peace,0.7,8,0,2024-06-22 15:24:41

* The Commander of the Israeli Police in Judea &amp; Samaria Major General Moshe Pinchi

* Reserve Colonel Netanel Shamka
* The Commander of the Samaria Region Sub-Commissioner Tzachi Sharabi

They demand to act urgently to prevent the entrance of Israeli citizens to area A (Palestinian cities). According to them every week &amp; especially on the weekend there's a phenomena of mass entrance of Israeli citizens to these territories; against the Israeli law; which creates a significant security risk &amp; large traffics on (other) entrances.

They complain that citizens living in the area are stuck in hours of traffic because of 'rule violators'. It creates a security risk (smuggling of weapons, explosives &amp; others) &amp; heavy traffic on route 55 during which local citizens are stuck in hours of traffic while being exposed to security risks (firing &amp; other type of attacks) without adequate protection.

Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, says that very specific Israeli citizens are entering area A (meaning Israeli Arabs) which turns those blockades &amp; law into 'apartheid blockades against Jews only' and again mention the security risks, the heavy traffic and adds the economical impact on Israel since those people that buy in area A don't pay taxes.

Uzal Vatik, Head of the Kedumim Council says that 

&gt;for years, security officials have been warning that Israelis entering Arab cities in Judea and Samaria is prohibited and dangerous, but in reality they mean Jews only.  
  
The danger is so high because those Israelis are roaming freely there and returning to our cities and towns all over Israel without proper inspection.   
  
This constitutes a disturbing and dangerous factor, as huge traffic jams are created together with vehicles that have left Area A without inspection.

The council leaders asked to

&gt;Act urgently to enforce the law preventing Israelis from entering Area A, to create public order and to maintain the security of our residents.   
  
the problem requires immediate and comprehensive treatment, both from a security perspective and to alleviate the traffic hardship of the residents of the area.

This has been going on for decades, the western powers enable it. I don't know what the agenda is, or what the end goal is.

  
But I sure as heck am tired of hearing people trying to rewrite history - and for what benefit exactly? Lying about war victims doesn't mean that hundreds of thousands of children haven't been m\*rdered at the hands of evil men.

  
I just don't get where the humanity has gone. I don't get what is apparently so terrible about peace in the minds of the western powers and Israel.

  
I just don't get all the hate, the crimes, the m\*rder, the r\*pe, the abuse, the torture, the theft, the destruction, the dehumanisation.

  
Like seriously wth is wrong with people? Can we not just all admit what we're witnessing with our own eyes and ears, and agree it's horrible, and that western powers and tyrant leaders are the ones to blame?

  
Why is it that ""loss of innocent life"" is the first go-to reason for ""evil doers"" as soon as it affects the west? (like with the ships that are being sunk by rebels who just want to see innocent people not being tortured and murdered).

It was not.

Hamas had been planning the attack for years with no particular scenario that'd cause it to launch this attack. October 7th was chosen not because on October 6th Israel provoked Hamas but because on October 7th there were fewer guards and Hamas knew that.  
Now, some pro-Hamas folks may argue that because Israel imposes a blockade on Gaza, that Gaza has a casus belli to attack, kidnap, rape and mutilate Israelis and western foreign nationals in southern Israel. But that's also not true. Not just because this type of medieval terrorism is not seen as legitimate by any 21st century sane human, but also because by that same logic, Israel can wake up at any day and bomb Gaza today with the same intensity of post October 7th, and claim it's a retribution for Hebron massacre in 1929. Or the DOZENS of October 7th attempts that Hamas carried out in 2023 alone up to October. Which is of course, a notion that they would reject.



But come on. Only those who do not know much about this conflict would make this argument. Historically, medieval Islamists have been attacking innocent civilian Jews with out provocation all over the region in different eras. Both pre 1948 and post 1948. You have the Hebron massacre, you have the Farhoud massacre, you have the Cairo riots, the Mouza exile, Aleppo riots 1947, and the list is endless. The persecution, abuse and terrorism that Mizrahi Jews were subjected to in the middle east is completely forgotten when discussing this conflict. Because it does not serve the Palestinian narrative in any shape or form. On the contrary, because Palestine itself historically has not been a good place for minorities -and it still is not, just ask non Muslims- this part of the history of the conflict proves why Israel is essential. Israel isn't only essential in its form but also in its idea. No minority should be subjected to what minorities are subjected to in this region. All minorities should have their own Israel. The Kurds, the Yazidis, the atheists, the Christians. Make a hundred Israels if need be, until the religious apartheid in the middle east ends. If the majority doesn't like it, well, it is not the minorities problem. Maybe the majority needs to stop deliberately worsening the minorities condition so they don't seek independence.

I’m curious about how the leaders of the “Uncommitted Movement” at the DNC last week are being perceived among supporters of Palestine, since it’s been reported that they had an opportunity to meet face to face with VP Harris, and they declined that meeting and demanded to be allowed to speak on stage instead, despite being told that wasn’t happening.  I guess I’m curious about how people are feeling about this.  [Here’s the Mother Jones article where it was reported.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/dnc-sit-in-palestine-uncommitted-movement/)

This article describes the strategies used at the DNC by the uncommitted delegates, and I really don’t understand how there could be any logical explanation for their choices.  They talked smack about the Democratic Party for three and a half weeks, they openly antagonized VP Harris repeatedly at her rallies, and then they *demanded* that she provide them with stage-time at the Democratic Party Cheerleading Event, despite the fact that they were literally calling themselves “uncommitted” (aka not voting for Democrats) and openly talking about their distain for and disappointment in the Democratic Party.  It’s genuinely inconceivable that they *would* have been allowed on stage, given that behavior.  And it should be noted that none of the other speakers were there because they demanded a speaking slot.   They were *invited* by the campaign and asked to speak in a way that aligned with the campaign’s themes of messaging which in this case was not.

The entire purpose of an event like the DNC is to build the party up and unify the message. Why didn’t the leaders of the uncommitted movement try to pivot at all, when Harris became the nominee?  When the campaign became about joy, why did they not shift their messaging to reinforce the joy and hope that Palestinians could feel, if a ceasefire/embargo were achieved?  They did literally *nothing* that would actually induce the Democratic Party to want work with them, except for threatening to withhold votes.  But given the unexpectedly small number of people who actually turned up to protest all they’re doing is showing that the Democratic Party can win without their votes, which makes them even more irrelevant in terms of political power.  No matter how loud they are on social media.

The idea that a serious activist could refuse a meeting with the future President of the United States, and instead demand 3-4 minutes on stage, seems very telling to me. These kinds of policies, like an arms embargo, are decided in the White House.  They’re not decided by the number of people who retweet a video of a speech.

It’s beyond belief to me, that anyone who truly cares about the issue they’re processing to advocate on behalf of would decline a meeting with the person who is actually going to be making those decisions after the elections.  The only person who would make a choice like that is a cynical liar who is upset about being denied their chance to go viral in front of an audience of 30 million. 

So I think the leaders of this movement are cynical frauds who are just milking the war to feather their own nests.  Based on the way they’ve behaved in the past month; it’s either that or else they are literally the most incompetent activists on the entire planet.  There’s no other explanation that logically explains their choices.",Uncommitted Organizers’ Strategy,0.78,34,0,2024-08-26 14:33:58

I am conducting Important Research^citation ^needed on UFOs and an esoteric military question has come up. Any help (or advice on where would be a better place to ask this question) would be greatly appreciated.  

Before you let the whole ""UFO"" thing scare you off, take a look at this event which occurred almost exactly one year ago:

&gt;Debris from the three low-altitude objects downed by U.S. Air Force air-to-air missiles last weekend hasn’t yet been found, and one of the missiles that missed its target is now at the bottom of Lake Huron, according to White House and Pentagon officials Tuesday. 

&gt;Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday “the first shot missed” when two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets were ordered to shoot the object over the lake.

&gt;“In this case the missile landed harmlessly in the water of Lake Huron, we tracked it all the way down. And we made sure the air space was clear of any commercial, civilian or recreational traffic.”

I read that Sidewinders have ""conventional annular blast fragmentation,"" meaning that the warhead can explode even if it misses its target and, therefore, still cause damage to its target.

The list price for Sidewinders is $400,000 each. The missile is not only highly accurate, but is designed to blow up even if it misses its target. But in this situation, we have a missile that not only missed its target, but failed to blow up at all, and fell into the lake. That is a very expensive dud. 

Back to my initial question: What happens to an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile that doesn't hit its target? What are the odds, first of all, of missing a target within visual range of the pilot, and what are the odds of the missile falling intact into the water instead of exploding? Are sidewinders supposed to detonate no matter what, or is there a way to disarm them remotely? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

The Ottoman Empire lost in WW1 and its land was split up into different protectorates and mandates governed by European powers. The British Mandate of Palestine consisted of modern day Israel, Palestine, and Jordan. This land, when owned by the Ottoman Empire, was largely ethnically and culturally homogenous. There may have been cultural differences between different districts but these minor differences existed not only between districts in modern Israel and modern Jordan but even in different districts within modern Israel, within modern Jordan, and within modern Palestine. 

When Jordan became an emirate and later a state, its population is therefore ethnically ""Palestinian"", or at least had no significant ethnic differences with the Palestinians west of the Jordan river. So, why isn't the creation of Jordan as a state considered the Palestinian homeland? The argument for an independent Palestinian state usually uses a ""right to self determination"" to argue that ethnic Palestinians deserve a state of their own. It seems to me though that Jordan IS that state. If this isn't the case, who is it that we are arguing deserves their own state and why are they culturally/ethnically different than Jordanians in the early 1900's?

The obvious counter to this is that I am simply wrong historically and that Palestinians west and east of the Jordan river had significant cultural differences that would necessitate the creation of 2 states rather than 1. My suspicion though is that ""Palestine"" is a country designed to be an opposition to Israel's existence. As far as I understand the original war in 1948 was between Israel and other Arab states, not Israel and Palestine, which didn't come into existence as a category of people until like 20 years later.

This arsenal would allow Hezbollah to fire approximately 3,000 rockets a day for three weeks straight which could potentially overwhelm the Iron Dome.

While this is likely welcome news in the eyes of many pro-Palestinians who would love to see Israel face ""retribution"" for its actions in Gaza, it is unlikely that they fully comprehend the consequences of such a scenario.

While the Iron Dome has obviously protected the lives of Israelis, it is rarely mentioned if at all that it also protects the lives of Palestinians when it intercepts rockets fired by Hamas and the PIJ. The Iron Dome gives Israel the ability to sustain numerous attacks without requiring a severe response in order to prevent damage to its infrastructure or death of its civilians.

However, if the Iron Dome was ever to be overwhelmed resulting in Israelis dying en masse and critical infrastructure being destroyed the gloves would immediately come off.

This is where the concept of proportionality comes in. Under International Humanitarian Law:

&gt;Launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited.

Assuming the current 97% success rate of the Iron Dome and 3,000 rockets a day for three weeks, Israel would be hit 1,890 times over that period. If Israel runs out of interceptor missiles or if Iron Dome batteries are hit, that number will skyrocket.

Due to the increased risk of damage and death from rocket and drone attacks, Israel would calculate proportionality much differently than it has done until now as the military advantage anticipated from taking out military targets would be significantly greater than the potential collateral damage caused by destroying Hezbollah's military infrastructure and personnel.

In other words, the IDF will adopt a scorched earth policy in Lebanon to prevent successful attacks on Israel making attacks on Gaza look pale in comparison.

As such, I think it is in everyone's best interest that the Iron Dome (and other defense systems) succeed at protecting Israel as much as pro-Palestinians may wish to revel at the alternative.",Pro-Palestinians should think twice before celebrating if the Iron Dome is overwhelmed by Hezbollah.,0.81,156,0,2024-06-24 00:12:48

The full and true stories of the native Arab inhabitants is largely lost to history, although the fragments that have been able to be put together do not point to an overall hostile Arab reception. I'm not saying that there were not isolated incidents of Arab hostility and even some organized groups.

I'm looking at the trends, and this is what I see: 

first, demographic data, birth rates, and cultural trends point towards the Israeli population becoming less European and less liberal. with time, it will become an ultra Orthodox state, jewish, but similar to Iran or Saudi Arabia as a theocracy, unrecognizable as a western democracy. at some point along this road, there will be a greater disconnect from Jews in the US and Western Europe, and Israeli will become one of the boys, one of the numerous Arab states quarrelling with other Arab states, scheming against each other, hatching alliances, this may actually help with its long-term survival. another way to say this is that Israel will assimilate into the larger culture of the Middle East and Arab world, which is marked by lack of democracy, religious extremism, and internecine warfare.


second, the genocide Israel is committing in Gaza will create an entire generation of Palestinians and Arabs that will hate Israel, and for legitimate reasons. likewise, any sympathy Israel and Jews across the world have received because of their treatment during the Holocaust will diminish as people begin to see Israelis as capable of committing the same types of atrocities as the Germans. this will be a major liability. Israel may become a pariah State like South Africa due to its apartheid-like treatment of Arabs within its borders. or the West (hypocritical) will pretend to hold its nose and deal with Israel much like it does with other states in the region with less than stellar human rights records.

third, during the ensuing decades, settlements on the west bank will continue to expand until all the Arabs on the West Bank are displaced and Israeli settlers occupy the entire West bank. something similar will happen in Gaza as Israel slowly encroaches from the north. with most Arabs removed from West Bank and Gaza or living there but without land rights, Israelis will begin to turn on each other. they're already doing that, but without these two flashpoints within its aspirational borders, this will escalate.

4th, the moral character of the nation will continue to deteriorate. it started off bad with the ethnic cleansing of Arabs, but the routine violation of international law on the West Bank, now the genocide in gaza, torture of prisoners, the rapes and sexual humiliations of Arabs, the looting, will further corrode Judaism in israel. the immorality tarnishes a people and has reverberations through multiple subsequent generations. again, it will become more like other Arab states. Jews from around the world who have these inclinations will move to israel, while Israelis who see the moral sickness in their country will emigrate. this is happening right now in slow motion. 

fifth, demographics will also increase the size of Israel's Arab neighbors making the country more susceptible to being overrun again especially as Western support wanes. Population projections for 2050 are Egypt at 147 million, Israel at 15 million, turkey at 103 million, and Iran at 99 million. the projection for the Palestinian territories is 10 million, but considering that Israel will continue to push Palestinians off of their land, this population will be either in Jordan or Egypt or incorporated into Israel proper. being the little kid on the block, Israel may use it smarts to form alliances and play one Arab State off against another.

six, democracy will decrease. it is happening now. netanyahu almost became a dictator. it was a close call. the next time he or someone like him will be successful, and then Israel becomes like turkey or Syria or egypt.

The quick summary of the pro-Palestinian perspective is that Zionists immigrated with the purpose of ethnic cleansing Arabs to form Israel, which is why Arabs resisted and denied partition. How then do you reconcile the denial of a [100% Arab state](https://israeled.org/resources/documents/decision-to-reject-a-majority-palestinian-arab-state/) over the entirety of Israel/Palestine for the sole reason of antisemitism?

To be fair, Arab politicians were deeply divided on the British offer coming with the White Paper; those who aligned with the Nashashibis’ political views were furious of the Arab Higher Committee’s refusal. They believed they had finally been offered what they wanted - a complete Arab State - and would unanimously agree to accept in short time. Unfortunately for them, the majority agreed with Hajj Amin Al-Husseini’s bigoted politics, thus eventually bringing the inevitable War of Independence/Nakba around a decade later. 

The pro-Palestinian view is that Arabs were being dispossessed on two fronts. Jews were purchasing land and evicting Arab towns, and Great Britain were attempting to partition the land to give Arab public land to Jews. The indigenous people were unfairly never given what was promised to them at the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and antisemitism didn’t play a role in the resistance of Zionism.

Yet the refusal of an Arab State that recognized a Jewish homeland (__not__ a Jewish state) where Jews would be equal citizens completely upends this perspective, and whenever it is brought up in conversation it seems to go largely ignored. 

Personally, I see antisemitism playing a large and deciding role in the proceedings of history. Arabs weren’t innocent bystanders watching their land being taken away, they were majority islamists rejecting Jews as equals. I will emphasize again that there were minority Arab parties who weren’t acting with antisemitic intentions, but the prevailing opinion at the time was working towards the complete removal of Jews in the region. The refusal of an Arab State by the AHC points to this conclusion. 

I’d like to hear the pro-Palestinian perspective on this refusal, since I don’t think I’ve ever seen more than just a dismissive response to it. ",How Do Pro-Palestinians Reconcile the Rejection of an Arab State In All British Mandate Palestine?,0.76,45,0,2024-03-20 18:14:15

Man of these claims are coming from tik tok (which is controlled by the Chinese government who promotes anti-Israel content) or highly biased news sources like Al-Jazeera (which is controlled by Qatari government who promotes anti-Israel content), or Wikipedia (anti-Israeli moderates have changed countless pages over the last year to ‘rewrite history’ via Wikipedia to be anti-Israel). 

The word “genocide” does not mean ‘alot of people were killed’. It means ‘destruction of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, either in whole or in part.’ Israel had withdrawn from Gaza in 2006 and allowed elections, why would that be the case if the intention was to kill all Palestinians? Israel invaded Gaza again after October 7th - as any country would have in response to the biggest terrorist attack in modern history. (Imagine after 9/11 the asking the US to do nothing I protect itself from further attacks by Osama bin Laden - that's roughly the equivalent of that you're asking Israel to do by not defending itself against Hamas.) 

Meanwhile Hamas very intentionally hides among Palestinian civilians so that any attempt to kill terrorists causes as much loss of civilians as possible- and Hamas wants this, not Israel. There is a number called civilian to combatant ratio - essentially, how many civilians have been killed in order to kill one combatant (in this case Hamas terrorist). The global numbers for modern urban warfare such as when the US from operating in Mosul range that I recall range anywhere from 9:1 to 4:1 (somewhere between 4-9 civilians killed for every one combatant), the estimates (even if you believe Hamas's reported numbers which you shouldn't because they change them - and the UN has acknowledged this) in Gaza are less than 2 civilians to 1 combatant- meaning that Israel has killed fewer civilians per combatant than ANY similar war in modern history - the exact opposite of what this number would look like if genocide was the goal. Yet did you hear claims of the US committing genocide in Mosul? Of course not, so how is that Israel is committing genocide if the ratio is less so much better? It doesn't stand to reason, unless you acknowledge that these claims are not based in facts but biased accusations made by sources whose goal is to hurt Israel. Lastly when there is a genocide, the population total drops dramatically. For instance after the Holocaust the total number of Jews in the world decreased from around 15 million to around 9 million (today there are still only around 15 million Jews in the world). The population of Palestinians continues to rise, even despite the terrible loss of life (30 thousand plus) that has occurred. There very simply cannot be a genocide where the total population does not make a huge decrease. This very simply has not occurred. I've heard people say, well if Israel 'could get away with it' they would commit genocide but the world 'won't let them get away with it' - I disagree but even within this those people are unintentionally acknowledging that Israel has NOT committed a genocide at this point in time. I'm not here to argue what Israel would-would not do 'if it could get away with it' that is conjecture. I'm here to say that in the real world in which we life, no genocide has occurred in Gaza. Some may legitimately misunderstand the very confusing ruling given by Court of International Justice about whether or not there has been a genocide in Gaza. There is a lot of confusing ""legal-ease"" wording but what the decision boiled down to was that Israel was NOT found to have committed genocide, instead the court asserted the people of Gaza are protected by law (like everyone in the whole world) from genocide. These are 2 very different things. Here is more information from the former head of this court if you're interested in this:
https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-68906919

There are millions of Palestinians in the West Bank. Why is there no ground invasion and bombing of the West Bank if the goal is to kill all Palestinians? There are millions of Palestinians in the Jordan, why has Israel not attacked Jordan? The answer is the same to all of these questions…it’s that Israel is fighting an incredibly difficult war against Hamas and destroying Hamas is the goal, not genocide. If Israel wanted to commit genocide ie killing all Palestinians - there would be no one left in Gaza, the West Bank or 1/2 of Jordan. There are many civilians being killed in Gaza (as there have been in every major war including World War I and World War II) that doesn’t mean that there’s a genocide. Please educate yourself further on this better by looking at reputable news sources not social media, Wikipedia, obviously biased news sources like Al Jazeera. Falsely accusing Israel, i.e. Jews of committing genocide, isn't attempt to draw a false equivalence between the genocide of the holocaust which the Jew suffered and what's happening in Gaza. Essentially to say, hey world 'you don't have to feel bad for Jews and what happened in the holocaust anymore because they're doing it to somebody else and therefore, it has evened out. You can go back to hating and attacking Jews without feeling bad for them or that you need to protect them as victims of the holocaust.""

Before you tell me to 'get educated' and post a link to a Al Jazeera know that I've done extensive research into the topic. I have taken classes at on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which included writing a proposal for what a peace agreement might look like between Israel and a Palestinian state, as well as written papers regarding the legal status of Palestinians according to international law in Gaza and the West Bank. I've lived in Israel. I am a Doctor who cared for Palestinian children with cancer. Through this education and experience I had many of preconceived ideas of what I had been taught by my family and the news changed. I highly recommend everyone considers doing so (not just scrolling on your phone and thinking you have the right to tell others to get 'educated'.) I am pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian and pro-peace and yes you can be all of the above, especially if you believe like I do a long term peace agreement in the context of a 2 state solution (which is what Ehud Barak offered to Yassir Arafat in 2000 which Arafat rejected partially because Hamas did not want it to occur, and partially because Arafat was embezzling billions of dollars and feared he would be not make more money and potentially be assasinnated if he signed it). We are as far away from this as we have ever been but the step towards peace is not a short term ceasefire that leaves Hamas in charge, it is removing Hamas so that a more moderate government that actually cares for the people of Gaza as opposed to stealing aid money from the Palestinian people (the top 3 heads of Hamas and Arafat's family have about $17 BILLION dollars, I wonder where that came from) and using them as human shields while they build terror tunnels for themselves. 

Many of you reading this who, like me, want what's best for the people of Gaza have been led to believe that supporting Hamas and being angry at Israel and as an extension, all Jews throughout the world, will somehow make things better for the people of Gaza. You have been lied to. Even if you hate Israel, please explain how for instance a Rabbi being killed in Dubai today makes life better for the people of Gaza. Explain how yelling at or attacking Jews on the street in your local town- or being silent while others do it- helps the people of Gaza. I am asking you to not triple down on your bias but instead please explore the following (if you're right and I'm wrong you should be able to listen to the other side of the argument without fear of having your mind changed, right?). Unfortunately there is no such thing as 'unbiased' news sources (some are pro-Israel, most are pro-Palestinian) but I have found BBC to be better than most (though even then it leans anti-Israel).

Before i start, i just want to note that im half Israeli but do not live there and have never lived there, but have been there on vacation. I don't know, someone ones told me to tell that when posting about the war because of bias or something like that. At the moment im kind of in between opinions, i once used to support Palestine but also used to support Israel at some point, at the moment i don't really know what to feel.  


I have seen people saying that Israel should at least help the innocent civilians in Palestine if their mission was to just eliminate Hamas and not the civilians. But what i do not understand is, how in the world are they supposed to distinguish hamas members and non hamas members?  


Per my understanding, hamas hides in schools, hospitals and civilians homes. Maybe even more places, but these are the ones i have heard people mention.  
I have even heard that they hide bombs or other weapons under kids beds (but that may just be Israeli propaganda, i don't know)  
Wich makes it very hard for the IDF to only target their attacks at hamas and finding out wich of the people are a part of hamas. Wich is kind of necessary since hamas does also continue to attack Israel, and if not getting rid of hamas it will allow for the attacks to continue.  


I have seen many people expecting Israel to be able to distinguish hamas and regular people, like they are magicians or something in that manner/lh

The amount of Jewish people I've met, I can probably count on one hand. I've never been exposed to ""the other side"" in a way that is meaningful-- and I'm sure that many of you feel the same way (from said ""other side""). I have some genuine questions-- some social and some political, feel free to choose-- that I'd like to ask from a place of curiosity and understanding:

1) Jewish Israelis: Do you have any Arab-Muslim friends? Did you grow up around Arab-Muslims? What was that like? Was there a sense of inclusion or was it more ""you stick with your own group?"" Do you find that Israel-Muslims/Arabs still hold solidarity with Palestine? What has that been like for you?

2) I was always under the impression that Hamas would not have existed had Israel not exile Palestinians from their homes in 1948. That is my current observation, especially since Gaza does not have its own legitimate ruling body. What is your take on that? This is of course is not an excuse for the tragedies to innocent civilians-- just a comment on the formation and maintenance of the group itself.

3) What are pro-Palestinian activists-- many of whom being Palestinian-- missing from the greater discussion? Many of the activists I know are Palestinians whose families have been displaced, who've been mistreated by IDF soldiers, who've experienced difficulties visiting their homelands and receiving food/water/medical, and whose family members have been even murdered by IDF.

4) There are often times I thought about visiting a synagogue and learning more about Jewish heritage/religion but feel a sense of grief with the looming sociopolitical issues over our heads. I don't say this to gain sympathy-- but just to ask if there are any Jews who feel the same way, that they would like to visit a mosque or learn more about Islam/the Middle East but feel this barrier. It's tough.

I'm simply stating information found with actual events they partook in with Jews. If it breaks rule 6, take down the post as you may.

&amp;#x200B;

This claim is mainly for the Westerners who want to look at every conflict with a Marxist/Intersectional Lense.

In a lot of media, it's becoming easy for the youth to label Israel as an apartheid state with outlets utilizing buzzwords such as ""systemic racism"" or ""oppressors"" when associating with Israel. Now, the way I'm defining buzzwords are alarms/whistles that allows people to form an opinion (with whoever these buzzwords are associated with) without having to do research.

This black and white approach has been very harmful to the Jewish community allowing increase in holocaust denial^(1) and antisemitism^(2).

We've heard the justification of these hateful actions because of the excuse that Israelis are the oppressors. However, when Pro-Palestinians bring up historical events painting it as Israel atrocities, most of the time its refusing to lack the context of the previous events. For example, the Arab Israeli conflict of 1948 is believed to have been an unjust act from Israel. But in reality, I will show you how it was actually a self-defense response to Anti-Jew/Pro-Nazi attack led by genocidal leadership (in Palestine).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hajj Amin al-Husseini, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and President of Mandate Palestine. Pro Palestinians don't like when I mention him because it will get dismissed that he either a) didn't contribute to much b) or didn't represent Palestinians views. However, the Huessini family was a well respect family and very powerful one to say the least in the Palestinian world (which explains how al-Husseini became the Grand Mufti). Husseini's success/popularity rose due to inciting aggression of violence against Jews (1920 Nebi Musa riots | a riot in reaction to Britain recognizing Jews having a state). Huesseini would commonly associate Jews with acts of wanting to incite violence such as attempting to kill Arabs or to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque (which ironically Jews today are beaten up for even trying to enter). Eventually, Huessini was labeled as a ""Proclamation of the Grand Mufti to the Islamic World"" thus dismantling the idea of Husseini having no influence.^(3)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Husseini was so good at spewing Jewish hate that he became 'friends' with a prominent leader named Adolf Hitler. (The Jewish Enemy by Jeffrey Herf pg. 179) ([https://imgur.com/a/yr5qgKS](https://imgur.com/a/yr5qgKS)). Nazi Germany and Husseini has such a familiar relationship with constant meetings, spreading each other's propaganda ^(4), and speaking light of each other publicly. Another thing I feel that I skipped over was Husseini's constant glossing over how the rhetoric against Jews was correspondent to the religion of Islam. This is what made antisemitism easy to spread with Islamic countries backing Huessini up this motive; we can back this up given that majority of Husseini's audience consisted of Arabs in the middle east who've associated Islam with their identity.

&amp;#x200B;

3. This one has a bit of speculation so this proof isn't asurring nor definitive enough to be waving around. Around 1939, Hans Piekenbrock, a German intelligence colonel, has been appeared to have boasted 'It was only as a result of the money we gave (al-Husayni) that it was possible to carry out the revolt in Palestine'.^(5)

&amp;#x200B;

4. Osman Kemal Haddad, Husseini's private secretary, traveled to Berlin Germany in 1940 to acknowledge and support Arab Nationalism and to discuss the ""Jewish Question""^(6). I don't think I have to disect this one much as we all know questions are only responded with by (Final) Solutions. For those who don't know, the Final Solution was implemented in the following year, 1941. Just to add some context, the Grand Mufti still had several relations in regards to handling Jewish migrating around Europe. So finally we have that famous image shared all over the internet with Huessini shaking hands with Hitler this is the meeting (PAY ATTENTION TO THE DATE: NOVEMBER 28, 1941) they held in 1941 to further discuss the ""Jewish Question"". After this meeting Hitler, had scheduled a conference called the Wannsee Conference (which was originally set to take place on December 9, 1941^(7) but got cancelled because of Pearl Harbor). This conference is what ultimately decided the Final Solution.

Backup for 7th source: [https://imgur.com/a/gUVtMaS](https://imgur.com/a/gUVtMaS)

Shortly after, Husseini encouraged more Arabs to help encourage genocide and Arabs from many nations (including Palestine) helped ensure that by 1948 over 860k jews were displaced from Arab countries.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Today, the Grand Mufti's legacy is not tarnished but rather praised in recent society. He's been called a savior, martyr^(8), and hero according to Arabs/Palestinians. This acceptance of genocide never disappeared. Many leaders of Palestine have continued to admit their support the killing of Jews.^(9) The number one supporters of this opinion is Hamas. Who have amassed 46.6% from Gaza and 68.3% from the West Bank in amount of Palestinian Support. Which also concludes to a 70.4% | 77.7% in support for a one state solution.^(10)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it is weird that people argue Hamas aren't terrorist. So, I will leave them with this piece of propaganda left by Hamas for Palestinian children.^(11)

* 56% say continuing the military offensive is the best way to recover the hostages, while 24% think a swap deal including the release of thousands more Palestinian prisoners from Israel's jails would be best.

Among Palestinians: 

* Support for Hamas has risen by 6% to 40%. 
* As of June 2024, 66% think the Oct. 7 attack was a correct decision - a 4% drop from the previous poll in March 2024.

SNA is Turkey's proxy and has been referred to as Turkey's Wagner. HTS is also backed by Turkey but not nearly as in bed with them and there has been a lot of tension increasing between HTS and SNA. Erdogan has tried to get them to work together and even unify, but it only led to more issues. Pretty sure the US DoD still has a $10M bounty out for al-Julani, the leader of HTS, who was the former al-Qaeda head in Syria. Although he's claimed to have moved away from extremism and has shown restraint in Aleppo. 

SDF is the US-backed Kurdish-led group, although they consist of several ethnicities and are now majority Arab. Their military arm, the YPG, has received some criticism. They control the northeastern part of Syria that's recognized by the US as an autonomous region. Turkey and Turkish-backed groups are their enemies. Turkey claims they are supporters of the PKK. Besides the YPG, they have a women's militia, the YPJ, and some smaller militias run by ethnic minorities in the area. SDF has mostly dedicated itself to protecting its territory from ISIS, Turkish forces, and Assad's forces. There are quite a few claims of forced conscription and have been clashes between SDF factions.

**What is propaganda?**

Propaganda is a set of strategies designed for persuasion. It can be used to convince people to believe in an idea, buy a product, or support a cause. Often an exaggeration of a stereotype or a basic truth, propaganda typically contains information that has been manipulated to influence public opinion.  

Propaganda builds upon core ideals that can be already found in a populace. It assumes an opinion and enforces it as fact usually with strong basic claims that can be understood and absorbed by a large majority.

According to Adolf H, ""The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly – it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.""

**What are common propaganda strategies or techniques.** 

The power in each of these lies in their appeal to one’s emotions over logic or reason.  Each emotion has a strategic advantage to turn a person’s opinion, and that emotion can be preyed upon by a single style of propaganda or multiple employed in tandem.

***Name-calling***

Uses insults to call out the perceived deficits of the competition or the opposing side. This name-calling can resort to the use of stereotypes and slurs.

 ***Generalities***

Generalities are empty words or words that are with vague, often unprovable statements.  Descriptors that are complimentary, subjective, and ultimately meaningless.

 ***Transfer***

Involves transferring the positive or negative value of something onto a person, product, or cause by association.

***Card-stacking or Cherry Picking***

Way of listing all of the features or aspects of a product, person, or cause that stresses the positive qualities while downplaying the negative or questionable qualities. The intention is to give the audience only a small part of the picture.

""In propaganda truth pays... It is a complete delusion to think of the brilliant propagandist as being a professional liar. The brilliant propagandist is the man who tells the truth, or [that selection of the truth which is requisite for his purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Lying_by_omission), and tells it in such a way that the recipient does not think he is receiving any propaganda... \[...\] The art of propaganda is not telling lies, but rather selecting the truth you require and giving it mixed up with some truths the audience wants to hear.""[\[18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques#cite_note-Macdonald2007-18)\]

 **Bandwagon**

Encourages people to join up with others or take part in something because everyone else is doing it — without critically thinking about why they would involve themselves. It additionally plays on our fear of missing out on something others are enjoying.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whatever cause you believe in, I urge you to think critically and avoid propaganda.   This includes recognizing when it is being used and avoiding using it yourself.   I urge you to also educate others to be able to do the same.  Most people in this forum are very emotional, and most of us are guilty of falling into the trap of propaganda at one time or another.   If you are correctly called out for use of propaganda, acknowledge it, and stop using it.

However, I myself can only conclude that too much has happened on both sides for there to be a diplomatic solution. I think it's time to face the realities on the ground and I see them as follows:

Israel is here to stay. They have the 4th or 5th strongest army in the world. Right behind them is the US, the strongest army in the worlds. Behind that are several European countries that would always provide military and financial aid. 

There will not be a Palestinian state in the West Bank. There are too many settlers there already and no Israeli government will ever make them leave. Remember how difficult and controversial it was to remove some 8,000 settlers from Gaza? There are almost 100 times (AFAIK) as many settlers in the West Bank and many of them would take to arms if they were forced to leave. Not gonna happen. I see a future with something like Native American reservations in the US since Israel will not annex all of the West Bank for demographic reasons. 

Gaza will remain what it is. A godforsaken piece of land that can't sustain itself. Israel will not lift the blockade unless there is 20 years of no rockets from Gaza. Gaza will never be allowed to have a military.

I am sorry for everyone who hopes for a more balanced and 'fair' solution but I simply don't believe in it. Palestinians lost this war/conflict. The status quo will continue. It will remain a mostly cold war with 'hot' times every 2 decades or so. Palestinians will kill Israeli civilians. Israel will respond with all its military might and we'll be back where we started. 

Palestinians will not win this conflict using violence. It's like a ten year old with a pocket knife attacking Mike Tyson with rifles and a tank.

The Jews were given the worst land which was mostly worthless disease filled swamps. Palestinians refusal to accept and recognize Israel from the start caused their suffering.

Palestinians caused the nakba themselves as the invading Arab countries told them leave so we won’t confuse you with Israelis and after we conquer and destroy Israel you can go back to your home. Yet as we all know that never happened. And now Palestinians want a right of return but then why aren’t we protesting Lebanon  and putting pressure on Lebanon to give Palestinians Lebanese citizenship. 

In fact we can’t the world force other Arab countries to grant citizenship to their Palestinian refugees. Look at Pakistan they allowed many Muslims to go there and have citizenship and integrate yet other Arab countries have failed to do. A right of return would not work as many Palestinians want citizenship in their host countries and many no longer want to go back and they can’t as it would be doable for every Palestinian to go back. 

Israel is not an ethnic state how is it. Most Jews there are not some white looking Ashkenazi from Ukraine, Poland or Germany and most are Mizrahim Arab looking Jews from Yemen, Iraq etc who were forced to flee to Israel due to Arab violence. And 25% of Israel is non Jewish and the 25% is Arab Muslims and Christians and Druze who are given the same rights as Jews. So claiming Israel is an apartheid state is untrue as Israel give freedom to its Arab citizens and they have more rights than Arabs anywhere else in the Arab world and Israel even has Islamist anti Zionist parties how could that exist if Israel was an apartheid state or an ethno colonial state. If you want to complain about ethnic colonial state we aren’t you protesting on the streets about Syria or Iraq trying to arabize Kurds or Azerbaijan taking over Armenian land or Türkiye preventing Kurds from having their state.

As the police convoy with the four coffins nears the Abu Kabir forensic institute, it becomes clearer that one of the biggest symbols of the horrors of Oct. 7th, Shiri Bibas, and her two young children Ariel (4 years old and Kfir (9 months old), who were kidnapped from their beds for ransom, did not make it out of Gaza alive. As in the actual Oct. 7th, the national grief is overlayed with another aspect: the Palestinian and pro-Palestinian attempts to justify their deaths, and blame it on the Israelis. In the gruesome festival organized by Hamas, proudly parading the corpses of the kidnapped civilians (the Bibases, along with the elderly pro-Palestinian activist Oded Lifshitz, murdered in captivity more recently), the centerpiece is trying to shift blame unto Netanyahu and ""the Nazi army"" who ""killed them with missiles from Zionist warplanes"".

As opposed to the usual conspiracy theory, that blames all deaths in Oct. 7th on ""Apache helicopters"" and the ""Hannibal protocol"" (and Hamas also adds, the thousands of ""innocent civilians"" that broke through the fence along with them), there's a chance that Hamas isn't lying here, and the Bibas family did die due to IDF bombs. At the moment of writing the post, we don't know. The Israeli government is keeping mum until the forensic examination of the bodies is complete. But it's important to remember, that even if the Hamas version of events is correct, it fundamentally wouldn't matter.

In 1979, a death squad from Lebanon broke into the apartment of the Haran family in Nahariya. They kidnapped the father, Danny, and the four-year old Einat. Danny was later shot, and Einat's head was smashed against the rocks, with the butt of Samir Kuntar's rifle (her brain matter was found on the butt). Smadar, the mother, hid from them in a crawl space, and tried to prevent her two-year old daughter Yael from crying, and ended up suffocating her. The members of the death squad, and most notably Samir Kuntar, were charged for the death of Yael, even though she was directly killed by her mother.

This isn't a quirk of Israeli law either. The ""proximate cause theory"" for felony murder, used in the US, is far broader than that. Even if the direct cause of death is caused by police or bystanders, the perpetrators could still be charged with actual murder, and even executed for it. While US Federal law (18 USC 1201) explicitly talks about how if ""the death of any person results"" from the kidnapping (regardless of how it results), the punishment is death or life imprisonment, the same as for murder. Other countries, like the UK, France, Germany, etc. might not go that far, but would still charge kidnappers under various forms of unlawful act manslaughter, as well as specific laws against kidnapping followed by the death of the victim.

If you, dear reader, try to kidnap a baby right now, in your own home town, and the baby dies as a result of a police shootout, I assure you that you won't be able to claim that the baby was ""murdered by the police"", and you can't be held responsible for his death. And if you then hold on to the baby's body, and demand a ransom to release it, this isn't exactly going to earn you points in your trial either.","Even if ""they were killed by Israeli bombs"", it's not an excuse",0.83,215,0,2025-02-20 11:57:12

lz9o7wd,0,And Palestinian muslim Arabs are descended more from Canaanite Phillistines Arabs and Jews who accepted dawah and the deen of islaam,IsraelPalestine,2024-11-27 17:04:05,1h16kbt,Ahmed_45901,0,0,0,True,2024-02-01 23:18:57,0.0,0.0,3173.0,14036.0,17209.0,13,"Is it true that the people who would come to be known as Falestinian people are mostly descended from Canaanites, Phillistines, Arabs and some Jews and Christianized Jews who later converted to Islam and accepted Dawah and the Deen and became Arabized? 

From what I heard the holy land was inhabited by ancient Semitic people who were ancestors of what we now call Jews, Samaritans and Palestinians. These ancient Semites called the Canaanites were ancient levantines who inhabited the land. The Jews were also another ancient Semitic Iron Age people who were a coalition of tribes and lived in the holy land along with the Canaanites. While the Samaritans a small subgroups of the Jews later developed out of differing beliefs. Later on when the sea peoples the same ones who pillaged Kemet a.k.a modern Masr or modern day Egypt settlers in the near east and one of them were Greek Hellenic islanders. These Hellenic islanders became the Phillistines of the Bible the same one from the David and Goliath story. 

From there I heard the Canaanites and the Phillistines never really converted to Judaism and kept their faiths and culture.

After Jesus P.B.U.H founded the Christian faith and ascended to Jannah his disciplines further solidified Christianity as a faith distinct from that of Judaism. By then most the Levants population mostly consisted of Jews and Jewish converts to Christianity and the mixed Phillistines Canaanite people who had largely abandoned their pagan faiths and adopted Christianity. And most spoke Latin, Greek and Aramaic in daily life.  

After the Roman took over the Holy land and expelled the Jews they renamed the area Syria Palestina after the Phillistines the ancient enemies of the Jews to sever any Jewish ties to the land. However the name stuck and was embraced as before the modern day state of Yisrael was founded everyone there regardless of religion was called a Palestinian so Jews and Christian would have been called that and Emmanuel Kant referred to the Jews living in Germany as the Palestinian foreigner and outsiders living amongst German Deutsch people. 

By the time of the Byzantine the demographics of the area were mostly the same as they had been since the founding of the Christian faith. However when Islam was founded and spread to regionthe Jews and Samaritans who had never left and weren’t exiled kept their religion and culture forming the Old Yishuv. While many of the Jews and the Jewish converts to Christianity and the mixed Canaanite Phillistines people converted to Al Islaam and accepted Dawah and the deen and adopted Arabic language and culture while mixing in with Arabs.

In short from what I’m understand both Palestinian Arabs who are Christian and Muslim and the Jews and Samaritans are descended of the ancient Semitic Canaanites who once lived on the land and modern day Palestinian Arabs are mostly descended of Canaanites like their Jewish brethren but have a more mixed ancestry and gene pool due to having Greco Phillistine and Arab genes. So ultimately I view Palestinians as mostly descended from Canaanites, Phillistine, Arab migrants to the land and a noticeable but small and minute amount of Jewish ancestry from Jews and Christinized Jews who converted to Islam.

What this means for the world (if not reversed) is as follows:

1. The ICC can impose its jurisdiction on any country including those who do not recognize it allowing them to bypass internal courts and the ICJ.
2. Assuming the standards applied to Israel by the ICC are applied to all countries, any country that engages in war will be subject to arrest warrants issued against their leaders and military commanders even if they follow international law.
3. The use of human shields and similar war crimes by terrorist groups has just become a legitimate strategy that will be encouraged by the ICC ruling. While the court may issue performative warrants against such groups to create the illusion of impartiality, any country that tries to fight them will not be able to without harming civilians thus invoking the wrath of the court.
4. World leaders will now have to choose between fighting terrorists who hide behind their own civilians and getting arrested or allowing such groups to attack them with impunity in order to avoid legal retribution by the ICC.

This ruling sets a dangerous precedent for the entire world and (in all but name) makes war itself illegal. Terrorists will be emboldened to implement strategies which make it impossible to defeat them without causing significant harm to civilians and allows such groups to push for arrest warrants anyone who dares oppose them.

So from all the pro Israelis i keep hearing the argument of self defense and the need to kill as many Hamas fighters as possible, who cowardly hide behind civilians so casualties are unavoidable. If we adopt this and think ahead, many Palestinians who are not fighters or extremist (majority are kids, eventually adults against Hamas but unable to act as freedom of speach is non existent) now will loose their kids, family members, friends, even journalists and doctors are getting killed. Even if the majority of current Hamas members get killed, what do yall think the survivors opinion on israel will be? Would they be happy they got saved after their whole bloodline gets annihilated? With schools destroyed and connection to outside world views mostly lost a lot of them get raised into the extremist narrative of Hamas aiming to a 1ss and kill all Jews. I think the current military action is not helping neither side and isnt damaging Hamas as much as alleged or moving Gaza to a more open democratic society. It is opening up a new argument for pro palestinians to say Israel doesn't want peace anymore, just killing as much palestinians as possible using bombs, starvation and missing health care is the objective.

If Israel really wants to defend its right to exist, why was the oct 7th attack even possible? If Israel right now knows where Hamas is located and where the hostages are and what they are planning, how did they not know that oct 7th will happen? It was a huge organized violent attack that needed weeks if not months to prepare. With the sheer amount of people involved i cannot fathom how israel didnt see it coming at all and reacted so slow and poorly. Clearly the border and defense system needs some investing instead of blasting the money of israeli and even american tax payers money as bombs on civilians who might have a terrorist under them.

It’s just not very good for neurodivergent people, and it seems the Jewish population has a lot of ND people in Israel and in the diaspora.

I wanted to Israelis both political and non political questions

1) are Israelis really that rude as people say? 

I never experienced Israeli tourists but I spoke to one who sells skin care and she was nice. My dad and I knew she was Israeli from the accent and we asked and she said, and she asked if my dad was Jewish and he said and he said he’s heartbroken over October 7th and hopes Israel gets rid of Hamas and she smiled and said thanks. On the other hand, I heard horror stories of rude Israelis, entitled, not cleaning up after themselves from many people. How true is this?

2) what is the education system like? I hear stories online about how they’re taught to hate Arabs that seems like a clip from a religious school and most Israelis aren’t taught this 

3) what about Israeli society would you change? 

4) what do you eat during Hanukkah or Passover or in general? I hear racist people assume Israelis eat bagels and lox when that’s more American Jewish food. 

5) would you serve in the idf if it was optional? 

I heard some Israelis say that the idf training is hard and they hated it a lot. 

6) if you’re a Palestinian living in Israel how do you like living there? 

7) how do you feel about Arabs saying they feel disconnected from Israel and Palestine. The national anthem of Israel being centered around Jewish identity and Judaism while feel alienated from Palestinians elsewhere because they’re Israeli citizens and don’t fit in



I always wanted to ask these questions especially the rudeness since it’s a common enough compliant that I figured it could be true or mistaking how blunt Israelis are for rudeness. The not cleaning up and bad table manners is a common complaint that I can’t rationalize. I’m lucky in my experience the Israelis I met in person were friendly and online the men are nice. I just noticed they were blunt and argumentative if you disagreed with them. One guy asked me a question nicely then would get aggressive if I didn’t agree and pushed back slightly in a nice way.

l6y1e30,2,"No, you don’t get the issue. There is no conflict between releasing the hostages and ending the war in Gaza. On the contrary, these two will be wrapped together in any agreement. So what’s first or “higher priority” doesn’t hold water....

The current crisis started on 10/7 with the Hamas attack and abduction of 220 hostages. It took Israel time until they started their offensive. Although during these days there were 0 casualties in,  Palestinian supporters refused to discuss the hostages. Actually, they even refused to mention Hamas by name. Now there are 35,000 casualties (which is questionable) but they refused discussing anything related to the hostages before there was one. 

There are couple of reasons: 

1) They don’t think taking (babies old people and women) hostage is bad, if these are Israelis. BTW they took, killed and abducted non Israelis (like Thai laborers). That’s also OK (by their logic) since they were on Israeli territory. 

2) They refuse mentioning Hamas by name. It may reflect badly on what they are doing and someone may even think the organization (AKA the freedom fighters/ the resistance) are evil. That’s not good. But then the Palestinian propaganda is trying every trick to gaslight the world, totally erasing Hamas from memory. As I read in one post: “Hamas does not exist. It’s an Israeli creation”. That’s what they want the world to believe! 

As such the reason that “35,000 casualties is a higher number than 220” - is laughable. Of course ignorant people believe them.

https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/s/UzxD7JtN6O

11) claiming pro Palestine Jews or Jews who criticize Israel’s war in Gaza as a self hating Jew or not actually Jewish 

Criticize those Jews all you want but unless you have proof they’re not Jewish I wouldn’t call them not Jews. Or in a similar experience I was accused by a Itamar Ben Gvir fan (I know not all Israelis are like this) of being a self hating Jew because I didn’t like his anti Palestinian racism or the bomb everything in Gaza comments 

12) well it’s just war, shouldn’t have started it, you can thank Hamas etc 

Regardless who started it these types of comments in my opinion lack compassion and just victim blame. Regardless who started things, showing compassion for Palestinian civilians is what everyone should do. Any civilian death is tragic 

13) getting defensive when someone criticizes a popular pro Israel figure 

I noticed that on social media with Mosab Hassan Yousef where pro Israel people will get defensive when people think he’s a horrible representative of the pro Israel cause. Mind you, I love Mosab’s story, read his book and like hearing him talk about Palestinian society but comments he’s made against Muslims calling them wolf in sheep’s clothing is racist and he’s too extreme and paints all pro Palestine people as just Hamas supporters. If you dislike him they’ll pull the he’s Palestinian he’s dad is the co founder of Hamas as that makes his racist or extreme statements okay 

14) blanket statements like no Palestinians want peace, where are the anti Hamas Palestinians etc 

I get how Israelis or pro Israel people might feel like reasonable Palestinian voices don’t exist but I know plenty including Palestinians in Gaza who criticize  Hamas on Twitter, it’s very similar to a Palestinian from the WB I spoke to who said no peaceful Israelis exist or no Israelis want peace 

15) a Palestinian state would reward Hamas 

I get why pro Israel people would think that but I feel like a 2ss would be a fuck you to Hamas because they wouldn’t want Israelis and Palestinians living side by side they want to keep the civilians hating Israelis and keep the hate filled cycle to continue 

16) not acknowledging Israeli’s faults and work to fix them 

I think there are pro Israel people who see very little faults with Israel but instead acknowledging Israel’s faults and work to fix them is a good thing 

17) only acknowledging how Palestinians need to trust Israelis and not the other way around 

I get with Palestinian education things are way worse and their textbooks are worse compared to Israeli textbooks but I’ve seen a number of Israelis online who see Palestinians as one dimensional and just terrorists or no Palestinian wants peace  and I think work needs to be done on the Israeli side to de radicalize those Israelis with extreme views 

18) excuses Israeli war crimes and actions with well Hamas is worse 

The standard shouldn’t be well I’m not as awful as a terrorist group, I know you might think that people are being stupid with the exclusion of pro Hamas people, people shouldn’t be saying things like Hamas and the idf are both bad if people didn’t see the idf on their phones showing off the bad things they’re doing 

19) dismiss Gaza health ministry stats because it’s Hamas controlled as if the lower numbers are better 

20) criticizing pro Palestine rallies for not bringing up Hamas and the hostages. 

21) Saying lgbtq people don't have rights in Gaza or mentioning how conservative Gaza is

Human rights aren't conditional, just because they're more conservative doesn't mean I want people dying

I get why they wouldn’t since from a pro Palestine perspective they see 35,000 Palestinian civilians way more important to tackle compared to 250 hostages and I don’t think every rally needs to condemn Hamas every time, it should happen once by the rally organizers. With talks for a ceasefire I think hostages should be mentioned

Personally, I originally was glad to hear that she was being treated well, as I do believe that young Palestinian guards under Hamas rule have no real reason to torture innocent people who are already captured.

ky4jn1c,1,"I agree and I get your original point as well, but I just didn’t think the comparisons were that apt. 

I think we can all agree that someone who is actually Palestinian should be granted a great deal of leniency for any possible “bias” against Jews, I don’t blame them. The ideal is to not hate, but no one has infinite understanding or compassion for a group that doesn’t have it for them (in their experiences). Like I said, just wanted to point out that I didn’t think your comparisons are great and that Arabs as a whole (non Palestinian) should try to focus their criticisms on Israel and zionists instead of a general group of “Jews”. Criticism of Jews as a group instead of Israel plays into the paranoia that Israel promotes among Jews for their own agenda. 

A lot of Jews are pro-Israel (I think most American Jews but not by a large margin), but there is a strong minority that’s very against Israel. I’ve noticed Reddit leans more pro-Israel overall, most neutral subreddits (general news or politics subreddits) are more pro-Israel from what I’ve seen.

On May 26th 2024 the IDF announced it had targeted and killed two senior Hamas members in an airstrike in Rafah. The two were: Yassin Rabia, the chief of staff of the armed group’s fighters in the West Bank and Khaled Nagar, another senior official in the West Bank wing accused of directing and carrying out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians. The strike came hours after Hamas fired a barrage of eight rockers from Rafah to Tel Aviv. Following the strike, the Gazan Health Ministry announced that 45 people, including women and children, had been killed in the strike. (Source: [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0kkqkngnedo))

In a statement released by the IDF, they claimed to have taken several steps to reduce collateral damage during the strike, including conducting “aerial surveillance and the deployment of precise munitions.” Based on these measures, the IDF believed “there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians.” However, following the reports of civilian casualties, the IDF stated that initial reports indicated that a “fire broke out, and that sadly took the lives of others.” (Source: [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0kkqkngnedo))

On the night of the explosion, multiple videos were released displaying distressing images of burnt and mutilated corpses in the chaos. In addition, one video shared on a Palestinian telegram group showed a video where two men can be heard talking about how the strike hit a Jeep containing explosives. 

The translation of this video was confirmed by two Arab Israelis public figures, Yahya Mahamid and Mansor Ashkar, both fluent in Arabic. (This is where I first found the [Video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7fBHuNJS6N/?igsh=MTBnZDgwYTc5NzdvYQ==)) The transcript goes as follows: 

Man 1: ""Did they attack a (Hamas) warehouse?""

Man 2: ""Not a warehouse, a vehicle filled with ammunition and weapons. It was a Jeep"" 

Man 1: ""Did it belong to the guys (Hamas)?"" 

Man 2: ""Of course, who else"" 

Man 1: ""Well, why was it here?""

Man 2: ""Go see for yourself""

Man 2: ""We can only trust in Allah ya Sheikh"" 

Man 2: ""Any moment, a (Hamas) rocket can fly at us"" 

On the 28th of May 2024, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the explosive used in the attack was a 17kg munition, which he described as ""the smallest our jets can use"" and could not have sparked a fire of that scale. He proceeded to say that “Weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we didn’t know of, may have ignited the fire” Hagari said the strike where two senior Hamas commanders were meeting, and that pictures posted on social media in the aftermath appear to show secondary explosions, which could have been caused by the weapons allegedly stored nearby. Furthermore, he refuted claims, stating that the target was 1.7km away from the safe zone.

In the briefing, Hagari also played an audio recording of an intercepted phone call from the night of the strike. The transcript goes as follows: ([Youtube 4:31](https://youtu.be/0r5Hp5cd78Y?si=4jAIUNc_WMe_5IYX))

Man 1: ""They had ammunition because all of the ammunition that started exploding, bags of money were flying in the air, Abu Rafik""

Man 2: ""These (the ammunition that exploded) were really ours?""

Man 1: ""Yes, this is an ammunition warehouse. I tell you, it exploded. I mean, the Jewish bombing wasn’t strong. It was a small missile because it didn’t create a large hole, and afterwards, a lot of secondary explosions.""

On the 29th of May 2024, fragments from the airstrike were captured in a video circulating on social media. CNN later geolocated the video to the same location using the camp’s entrance sign and the tiles on the ground. The video showed the tail of a US-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb (SDB), according to four explosive weapons experts who reviewed the footage for CNN. (Source: [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html))

*Processing img 5zx9nmcokg3d1...*

The Description of the GBU-39 reads: (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-39_Small_Diameter_Bomb))

The small size of the bomb allows a single strike aircraft to carry more of the munitions than is possible using currently available bomb units. The SDB carries approximately 36 lb (16 kg) of AFX-757 high explosive. It has integrated ""DiamondBack"" type wings, which deploy after release, increasing the glide time and, therefore, the maximum range. Its size and accuracy allow for an effective munition with less collateral damage.Warhead penetration is 3 ft (1 m) of steel-reinforced concrete under 3 ft (1 m) of earth, and the fuze has electronic safe and fire (ESAF) cockpit selectable functions, including air burst and delayed options."" 

This confirms the statements made by Daniel Hagari, indicating that the bomb used was the smallest munition in the IDF arsenal that could be equipped with the F-15 used to carry out the strike. I'm definitely no weapons expert the destruction caused seems to disproportional to the size of the munition used. ",Rafah,0.75,57,0,2024-05-30 01:57:27

I think one of the biggest clashes in the Pro-israeli and Pro-palestine talking points is about the legitimacy of the state of Israel existing. 

Pro-Israelis, please explain why you think Palestinians, especially those who were displaced during the nakba and denied the right of return, rendering many of them stateless or as refugees, should accept the existance of Israel as a Jewish state.Would you accept it in their shoes?

Pro-Palestinians, please explain what you think is a realistic solution to the current situation. How do you recommend we deal with 75 years of concentrated Jewish presence in historic Palestine. In your version of Palestine, what should the current Israelis do? where do they fit in? would you accept it in their shoes?

My thoughts as a Palestinian refugee displaced to the west bank:

a single state for everyone. I don't think it's realistic to have two states. I disagree with the premise for the creation of Israel as exclusively a Jewish state.

I tried to search here before, and I noticed that everyone that criticizes the Osprey-22 is called a ""reformist"" (whatever that means) followed by the affirmation *""the V-22 is safe""* without further explanation.

Every news I see is either how the aircraft crashed *""again""*, how **it is actually very safe** and that it was the one of the few aircrafts were [the president was prohibited to be transported in](https://youtu.be/nDUHKDXjR4Y) because it can't safely glide in an emergency.

I know that the aircraft is an hybrid, but in case of emergency on the rotors, wouldn't the aircraft be under extremely danger if one of the rotors were defective and/or couldn't rotate to horizontal position? [From pictures](https://www.airforce-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/11/Image-1-V-22-Osprey-Tilt-Rotor-Aircraft-1.jpg), the rotors can't even rotate horizontally on the ground without hitting it.

The only one that I saw in which these problems seem to be adressed was the V-280, and that aircraft doesn't seem to be able to land horizontally either (in a situation where the tilt mechanism is somewhat defective).

Obviously, I'm not an aerospace engineer, but all these problems makes me wonder if they couldn't fix them.   
I'd assume that the actual engineers adressed all these problems, but I don't know where nor when they adressed these problems.

For example: *""if something where to happen to the tilt rotor/connecting rods of the rotors, the damage would be so bad that it would simply fall to the ground like a rock, so we work to avoid that""*",Discussion: Why is the Osprey V-22 so loved and hated wherever I go?,0.85,46,0,2024-01-03 12:36:50

l8vs6sr,11,"I understand your confusion and concern regarding the ""Queers for Palestine"" movement, given the stark differences in LGBT rights between Israel and Palestinian territories like Gaza and the West Bank.

The “Queers for Palestine” movement can be perplexing at first glance, especially considering that Palestinian territories are indeed some of the most anti-LGBT regions according to the global equality index, while Israel is relatively more progressive in this regard. Here are a few points that might help clarify this stance:

1. **Solidarity and Intersectionality**: Many in the LGBT community feel a strong sense of solidarity with other marginalized and oppressed groups. They see the plight of Palestinians as a human rights issue and believe in supporting their struggle against occupation and for self-determination, regardless of the region's stance on LGBT rights. This perspective is often rooted in the principle of intersectionality, which emphasizes the interconnected nature of social categorizations and oppressions.
2. **Distinction Between Government and People**: Supporters often distinguish between the policies of the Palestinian authorities and the Palestinian people. They argue that supporting Palestinians does not mean endorsing the oppressive policies of Hamas or the Palestinian Authority but rather supporting the broader population's right to live free from occupation and conflict.
3. **Critique of Pinkwashing**: Some activists critique what they see as ""pinkwashing"" by Israel—using its relatively progressive stance on LGBT rights to divert attention from its policies towards Palestinians. They argue that highlighting LGBT rights in Israel should not overshadow or excuse the treatment of Palestinians under occupation.
4. **Universal Human Rights**: Advocates believe in universal human rights for all people, including Palestinians. They argue that the fight for LGBT rights and the fight against occupation and for Palestinian self-determination are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they believe that a free and fair society for Palestinians could potentially lead to better conditions for LGBT individuals there as well.

Your concern about the future Palestinian state's treatment of LGBT people is valid and important. Advocates for Palestinian rights, including those in the LGBT community, should continue to push for human rights and equality for all, regardless of the political or social context.

It's a complex and emotionally charged issue, and it's important to approach it with empathy and a willingness to understand the perspectives and struggles of all involved. While Israel’s progressive stance on LGBT rights is commendable, it does not negate the broader human rights concerns regarding the Palestinian territories.

Thanks for sharing the links and information; it’s crucial to stay informed and consider multiple perspectives when discussing such significant issues.",IsraelPalestine,2024-06-16 17:04:29,1dgxrh7,Ready-Bit6310,0,11,0,True,2024-06-10 16:58:40,0.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,13.0,146,"I understand there’s a war going on, which was started by Hamas, and that innocent people have died, but I would like to understand more about the “queers for Palestine” movement. Palestine (Gaza and the West Bank) are two of the most anti LGBT countries in the world according to the global equality index (Israel is ranked somewhere near the top as the most equal). I understand if you feel empathy for the innocent people dying in Gaza and want to help, I feel empathy for them as well, I am just curious what this has to do with being Gay and why people feel the need to tie their political positions with their sexuality. 

Why advocate so passionately for a Palestinian state if the majority people there likely hate you and want you imprisoned or worse? I am in favour of a two state solution eventually, after the hostages are released, the war is over and the West Bank has agreed to deradicalize, but few people have bothered to ask what the new Palestinian state would look like for lgbt people. I understand we cannot impose our values on anyone but the safety and freedom of all LGBT people, including lgbt Palestinians, should be a priority for the community. 

TLDR: Israel is the only pro lgbt country in the region with the largest pride parade and Palestine is at the bottom of the lgbt equality index. Why do so many gay and bisexual people still support Palestine over Israel?

They are still in the first 30 mins of it, making introductions and reading definitions, provisions, etc. South Africa will be making its arguments first, with a time allowance of 3 hours, and then Israel will be given 3 hours to rebut and defend the accusation. 

South Africa has brought colleagues that were IN GAZA a few days ago with them to the courtroom. Unhinged. 

It’s wild to me that a country that went through an apartheid itself is now taking another country to court for genocide. 

If it’s not a genocide, what is it exactly? We have seen the accuracy in military the IDF is capable of (Lebanon), but fail to see this in Gaza. 

I’m sitting at the edge of my seat. The opening judge mentioned that a decision should be made by Feb 6, and that if South Africa wins, the provisions will begin a few weeks after. 

IF South Africa wins, Israel will officially be known as a genocidal state, and the U.S. along with President Biden will be public ally condemned for being complicit in a genocide (by using tax dollars to fund the damn thing)


They will be going over intent, threats, rights of Palestinians, agency, harm done, etc. 

I only hope this results in no more deaths and Justice for all. I can't imagine the judges ruling otherwise but I've been surprised before. In any case, what judges do you think will vote in which way? Respectful responses only pls!

In the 1947 vote for the UN Partition Plan for Palestine, Mexico was one of ten countries that abstained from voting.

In Oct, Mexico condemned the Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct 7th &amp; the ensuing Israeli military response &amp; has called for peace between both sides and for a two-State solution.

During the ensuing conflict, Mexico has maintained a moderate posture with Israel, in comparison to other Latin American countries such as Colombia &amp; Chile. 

Mexico recognized Israel in 1949 &amp; both nations established formal diplomatic relations on 1 July 1952.

Save the world that today is called Gaza

I come from a Jewish family and I am proud of my grandparents and my parents. My paternal grandmother, exiled from Lithuania for economic and racial reasons, arrived in Mexico with part of her family in the second decade of the 20th century. My paternal grandfather arrived in Mexico around the same time, also exiled from Lithuania, for political and racial reasons: he was Jewish and a communist.

My maternal grandparents came to Mexico fleeing Nazi persecution. They were saved by a miracle. Many of my relatives from that generation were exterminated in the concentration camps. Both families decided to make Mexico their homeland. I was raised as a Mexican. Loving its history and its people. I am Mexican and that is why I fight for my country. I cannot and do not want to deny my history, to do so would be, as León Gieco says, to deny the soul of life. But I am also a citizen of the world, because of my history and because that is how I think it should be.

I am referring, of course, to libertarian, humanist, non-racist men and women who fight for peace… “Imagine”, as John Lenon composed. Therefore, because of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings. Israeli in Gaza... No reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians... Nothing, nothing, nothing, can justify the murder of a child. For this reason, I join the cry of millions around the world who are calling for a ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian territory. As Alberto Szpunberg, Argentine poet, said in a recent letter: “that is what it is about: saving a world, this unique and anguished world that we all inhabit, that belongs to everyone and that today is called Gaza.”

llb3tsr,1,"I believe the sad answer is to kill all Jews &amp; destroy Israel. Here's the reasons why I believe so:

1. Every poll conducted on Palestinians about the subject literally said so, from written polls to video polls - in all the answer was the same.
2. Think about it from the Palestinians eyes: imagine you lived in a place for a very long and suddenly a group of new people come and take some of the place - you wouldn't think about a country or not a country, you'd only care about taking what you believe is yours back.
3. Between 1948-1967 Gaza was under Egypt's control and Judea &amp; Samaria (also known by the Jordanian name of the west bank of the Jordan river) were under Jordan control. Despite that, most of the focus of the Palestinians was still trying to destroy Israel. I'm not claiming they didn't give troubles to their host country, but really not as much as they gave Israel... 
4. I did a research on the Palestinian education system and it literally teaches just that... Not to long ago the European union even threatened the PA with sanction so it would start removing those hateful messages.

As I can see it, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has 4 sides.

1. Israelis (people who are living inside Israel, experience Israel, and know Israel).

2. Palestinians (people who are living inside the Palestinian Authority, experience the PA, and know the PA).

3. Pro-Palestine foreigners.

4. Pro-Israel foreigners.

I believe it's important to recognise first that we have these four sides in this conflict. And it's important to know and understand all the various sub-divisions that each of these sides have, but that's a post for another time because here I want to focus on the unique dynamics between the first two sides; the Israelis and the Palestinians. 

For this time, I want to lay down my thoughts and write down a few things that I've noticed about this unique relationship. 

Of course, it can be a very long list of differences and similarities between the two, so I've decided to focus on the three most important distinctions that I believe I know when I say that they're true and sound when they're said about the way Israelis and Palestinians are entangled with each other;

1. Both sides hate each; but the Palestinians hate the Israelis even more; perhaps, it should not be a surprise to anyone since objectively speaking, Palestinians have endured more suffering with more losses than the Israelis in the history of this conflict. The crux of this whole Israel Vs Palestine debate is really about who is to blame for their own and the other side's comeuppance. 

What's true at the surface, is that Israelis do in fact hate the Palestinians, or at least, they hate those who carry out terror acts, and those who support it. 

But what happens when children die in Gaza? 

To tell the truth, Israelis just don't care, they don't cry out in joy when they see the high Palestinian death toll, but their hearts don't bleed for them either. 

Now, as for the Palestinians, which I believe that because of their situation in this conflict, being the weaker agents, they really do have a strong desire to wreak havoc on Israel. 

When somebody in Israel cries because of something that some Palestinian did to a random Israeli (like a stabbing attack, or driving a car into a bus station with Israelis); to every mourning Israeli, there is a higher number of Palestinians who cheer and celebrate the loss of Israeli lives; especially if they're Israeli soldiers. And Israeli soldiers are like sacred cows in Israel, because the country is so small, which is why the IDF and the civilian population of Israel are one and the same. 

2. Palestinians know much more about Israel than Israelis know about Palestine; I may be wrong on this, but from what I've noticed going through life here in Israel, is that the Palestinians seem to possess much more knowledge about the internal workings of Israel; like its people, their in-group differences and similarities, and their collective lifestyle inside Israel. 

3. The Palestinian population is much more homogeneous than the Israeli population; even if we put Israeli Arabs outside the equation; Israeli Jews have much more plurality in-between based on race, ethnicity, religious belief, and political stance. 

Though I'm pro-Israel as things currently stand because I'm Israeli, and I value my life and lifestyle in Israel. It does not mean to me that I'm anti-Palestine or whatever. The existence of a Palestinian state depends only on whether it's dangerous or not to the Jewish State. In the long term, I even believe that there is no problem in mixing the two populations to form a singular state based on some other identity besides Israeli/Jewish and Palestinian/Arab.

But because I see the Palestinian side as less compromising than the Israeli side, I'm compelled to reject the Pro-Palestinian side simply because it does not allow me room to breathe.

I only wish that more Israelis were politically pragmatic as me, and even more so the Palestinians.",Here is the difference between the Israelis and the Palestinians,0.76,78,0,2024-03-12 01:33:57

... Even Ashkenazi Jews who are the Jews most familiar to Westerners, despite that they appear somewhat white, genetic studies on them conclude that they have more affinity to the Middle East than to Europe. 

... At least half of Israel's Jewish population are Jews who came from Muslim and Arab countries. And they are far from being white in appearance. 

... Speaking of Israel's Mizrahi/Sephardic Jewish population, they are statistically the most likely to hold right-wing views and vote for the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu and those are far more to the right than him. Whereas, the Israeli left is mostly composed of those who are called ""Ashkenazi Jews"" (The Jews who are most familiar to Europe and America). 

Which means that the ""White Jewish"" population of Israel, which is only half of Israel's Jews, is much more oriented towards peace, negotiations, and compromise which involves legitimate security risks for Israel.* 

* If you're heavily pro- Palestinian, it means that you will oppose anything except a Palestinian state even in places that are officially recognised as Israel, in which case you shouldn't deny that the State of Israel is going to have legitimate security concerns as a Jewish State when the establishment of a full Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank looms on the horizon. 

* Unless of course if you believe that most of the Palestinians in the occupied territories are willing to have diplomatic relations with the State of Israel nextdoor if they get to have a state of their own in the territories which are internationally recognised as Palestinian. 

P.S. 

Even though I live in Israel and I hold an Israeli passport, which just happens to be true because I was born here, and my immediate environment decided for me that being a citizen of Israel is just going to be the reality for me unless I decide to do something otherwise like moving out if I had the means of course. Philosophically speaking I'm an Objectivist which means that I would like not to affiliate myself with any particular collective identify just on the basis of feeling that you belong to a particular tribe and that tribe is better than any other tribe just because you belong to the tribe which you belong. 

The question I have for the Pro-Palestinian community is this: 

Why the suffering of a certain group of people (Palestinians) means that they're morally superior to the other group which causes their suffering (Israelis/Zionists) if the former group (Palestinians) doesn't believe that the latter group (Israelis/Zionists) should have been treated with courtesy if they sued for peace and coexistence at the start?

Do you believe that the Palestinians would agree to coexist with the Jewish immigrants who came from Europe to Mandatory Palestine before the conflict began if it weren't for Jewish separatism? Or do you believe that it doesn't matter because the Jews shouldn't have been coming to Mandatory Palestine in the first place because they are not native, and the Palestinians had every right to rebel against their presence in the land of Palestine even if the Jews were coming to sue for peace coexistence themselves?",Why is Israel called a White Colonial Settler state when...,0.69,80,0,2024-05-23 09:33:54

Palestinians have proven again and again they're unable to create a stable government yet countries like Spain or Norway recognize a Palestinian state (although they don't know where to put their embassy of course) because their western arrogance obviously knows what the locals want more than the locals themselves.

Is there really still any doubt about what Palestinianism truly is? Which is just a way to unite Arabs and Muslims against a common enemy?

What are people’s takes on Jewish Voice for Peace? 

I am non Jewish, but find some of the strong takes from some pro Palestinian Jewish activists to be confusing. 

I often find the rhetoric that I see at protests such as ‘by any means necessary,’ or ‘resistance is justified’ to be blatantly devaluing the lives of Hamas’s victims at best, and broadly anti semitic at its worst. 

I find it interesting that one of the most prominent Jewish student groups is being used to rubber stamp a lot of these protests, or these chants as a way for activists to gaslight the public and insist they’re not anti semitic, or to evade any questioning about the morality of rape, torture and murder. 

Essentially allowing them the intellectual cowardice/umbrella to insulate themselves from critical thought, and to invest in more blatantly anti semitic, or conspiracy theories behind closed doors. 

I follow a lot of pro Palestine pages, and it’s not uncommon to see comments or posts that suggest 10/7 may not have even happened. Or falsely claim that Hamas only fought IDF soldiers and it was the IDF that killed innocents in their response. Often these will be on pages run by pro Palestinian people who identify as Jewish. 

I’m not Jewish, and I’m not Israeli, but I couldn’t imagine being part of an org that so blatantly devalued lives, especially and particularly Jewish lives.

Am I wrong in my read on this? Please challenge me, or tell me if I’m the one who is misinformed. 

Thanks

People get so caught up in their own perceptions of what those terms should mean, but they fail to acknowledge that labels aren’t always black and white. You can hold complex, nuanced views that don’t necessarily fit into one rigid category. It’s frustrating because these labels have become so politicized, and often, the true meaning of the terms gets lost in the noise.

You guys can disagree, and that's fine, but that won’t change the fact that it's a fact—both perspectives can exist simultaneously. Just because someone identifies as pro-Palestinian doesn’t mean they must oppose the rights of Jewish people to self-determination in Israel. Similarly, being pro-Israel or a supporter of Zionism doesn’t automatically mean you’re dismissing the struggles of Palestinians or their right to sovereignty. These positions aren’t inherently contradictory, but they are often framed as such by polarized rhetoric that reduces complicated issues into an “either/or” debate.

Pro-Palestinian doesn’t have a singular or fixed definition. It can mean many different things to different people—whether it's about supporting Palestinian human rights, advocating for an end to occupation, or seeking justice for displaced families. Zionism, on the other hand, does have a more concrete definition, one centered around the belief that Jews have the right to self-determination and to live in their ancestral homeland of Israel.

Right now, the whole Middle East is heartbroken over the plight of the people of Gaza, and many friends wish for the Resistance Axis to launch a massive attack on Israel immediately. I understand everyone's grief, but grief itself isn't power. To turn grief into strength, careful planning is essential, as is obedience to command and adherence to discipline. The military victories that the Resistance Axis has achieved over the years have all been based on these principles. Almost every fighter in the Resistance Axis has a blood feud with Israel, but the reason they've grown into strong, mature fighters is that they've been educated in practice and wholeheartedly accept the organizational principles of the Resistance Axis regarding frontline struggle. If you recognize our work, if our victories inspire you, then please also support the leadership of the Resistance Axis, trust the judgment of the Resistance Axis, and understand the strategy of the Resistance Axis.

So, what is our frontline struggle strategy? It's something I can talk about. Even if we speak openly, the United States and Israel can do nothing but grow more fearful and anxious. Our struggle strategy is simple and effective, summarized in just six words: tie the ropes, stab with the knife.

Thanks to excellent infiltration work, the Resistance Axis has managed to entrap and bind the forces of restorationism in the Middle East, then gradually tighten the rope, increasing Israel's pain and exhaustion. During this process, we also continuously observe the enemy's weaknesses, and when a good opportunity arises, we pounce and make a deep stab, letting the blood flow. It's the tactic of a hunter dealing with a fierce beast.

The Hamas raid on October 7th was a fine example of a stabbing action. Since then, Hezbollah has tied up a significant number of elite Israeli forces in the north with its beautiful exchange rates and forced a large number of settlers to relocate southward—outstanding rope-tying work that could turn into a stabbing at any time. The Houthi brothers have drawn Israeli and even American high-tech anti-aircraft forces down south, and the gradual escalation of mobilization by big brother Iran has greatly increased the enemy's decision-making difficulties. These are deeper and more comprehensive steps in the rope-tying process.

In a panic, the United States has chaotically poured vast resources into the Middle East without proper planning and, due to political pressure, is unable to withdraw, gradually becoming ensnared by our ropes as well. Of course, the US is a much more powerful enemy than Israel. To tie the US with ropes, relying on the Middle East alone isn't enough, but the Chinese and Russians have already tied up the other tentacles of US imperialism in their own ways in other places. After the outbreak of this Middle Eastern conflict, from a global perspective, the rope-tying work against the American imperialists has essentially been completed.

Why are the Americans so panicked? Are they just worried about Israel? Or do they also realize that the whole world is a large Middle East, and the US is just a larger Israel? If Israel is tied with ropes, everyone will have the opportunity to stab with the knife. Could the US face a similar fate? Could Israel's today be America's tomorrow?

Six Political Propaganda Slogans.

Of course, today's speech is a bit of political propaganda. Since we're doing propaganda, we've got some powerful slogans for different audiences. We already have plenty of slogans for our own folks. Here are some for our enemies and friends that you can use in the upcoming information and people's warfare.

For Europeans, we say: ""If you can break free from the US, you'll be of the highest strategic value to us; if you can't, then even blaming you is just a waste of time.""

For the Chinese, Russians, and North Koreans, we say: ""You do your thing; we'll handle our battles. We have faith that you'll win, and we ask you to believe that we can hold our ground.""

For Americans, we say: ""You're bound to lose to the Chinese. And when the time comes, it'll be your allies who are stabbing you in the back.""

For Israelis, we say: ""If you're unlucky, the US will eventually betray you; if you're lucky, the US will eventually abandon you.""

Will fellow Arab nations support them more or less once they aren’t a means through which to take a stance against Israel?


On a budget level, would the 40% of GDP stemming from taxes collected by Israel immediately tank the economy or is there some kind of course correction for this?

Workforce-wise, wouldn’t the able-bodied men who might’ve remained in the country for militaristic/ideological reasons seek economic opportunities elsewhere in the world?

This is a bit conspiracy theory not based on direct facts but some of this is being investigated and/or sued in the court system.

The American morals &amp; values are under attack and have reached various institutions from education all the way to the government.

With the last external interference in which it was claimed that Russia tried to influence the American election, external dictatorship forces seems to have up their game, and this has a world wide implications.

# Education

The American education system has not only received funds from dictatorships but seems to have been influenced by them, as can be seen from professors teaching one sided view without any critical thinking on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

This include not only professors but student bodies &amp; other internal organizations that do not abide by the American values &amp; morals like freedom of speech. Those insist that freedom of speech is for them but not for ~~Jews~~ (illegal, instead use:) Zionists 

# Protests

This seems to be fueled by giving money to people in order to protest. Once you reach enough critical mass you get what you've seen on TV and some videos: 

People protesting to ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" but not knowing the basic things about the conflict like which river and which sea?

Who would waste their time going and protesting something he knows nothing about? Someone who was paid.

Once you reach ""critical mass"" you get what some others have reported: people going to those protests because that's where their friends are and the cool thing to do.

# Media

Western media has long had a problem when hiring certain people who do not adhere to journalistic values. Or just biased people

# The Government

Not only the western media has an issue when hiring certain people with different values but the government too.

This is partly fine since we're a democracy and not requiring all people to think the same. But combine that and the rest of the noise, social pressure, data report from ISIS itself on the number &amp; type of casualty figures and you end up with stupid antisemitic statements like the recent one:

&gt;The US does **believe** that Israel used American weapons in a way that does not comply with international law - but **not enough information has been found on specific cases** in which the law was violated and that would justify preventing the continuation of military aid from Washington.

or in other words: ""We're sure that you're a \_\_\_\_\_ up to no good but we didn't found any dirt (or cold hard facts) on you yet""

But because we were so sure that you're a \_\_\_\_, we've acted upon our suspicion.

[In their original 1988 charter](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/880818.htm), Hamas clearly lays out their goal of annihilating Israel and Jews through Jihad (Islamic Holy War).

&gt;'Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.' (Preamble)

&gt;'The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.' (Article 7)

&gt;'There is no solution for the Palestinian problem except by Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility.' (Article 13)

&gt;'The day the enemies usurp part of Moslem land, Jihad becomes the individual duty of every Moslem. In the face of the Jews' usurpation, it is compulsory that the banner of Jihad be raised.' (Article 15)

The magnitude of this anti-Jew, anti-Israel, and self sacrifice ideology is such that it is a core part of Palestinian youth education and media. There are many examples, but here are just a few. The first two would be comical if they weren't so perverse and diabolical.

I'd encourage people to read through this page if any.

Hamas's actions are in line with their stated aims. On October 7, Hamas and Gazan civilians can be seen [celebrating over dead Israeli bodies](http://thisishamas.com). One video shows Gazans cheering, dancing, and spitting on dead naked Israeli woman, reflecting the fact that systemic rape on Oct 7 [occurred](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15621.doc.htm). [Over 70% of Palestinians](https://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Poll%2091%20English%20press%20release%2020%20March%202024.pdf) support the actions on Oct 7. Hamas has [promised to repeat Oct 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNccvNJtGk) again and again.

We also see this ideology reflected in the Palestinian Authority's [""Pay for Slay""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund), a fund that pays West Bank Palestinians a stipend for committing terrorism against Israel.

The point of sharing these things is not to demonize Palestinians or make any sort of justification. The point is that in the west, we mistranslate this conflict into a framework that we comprehend and sympathize with. For most westerners, it's difficult to commiserate with religious fundamentalists and accept that they might want different things than we do (such as [using billions of dollars in aid for terrorism instead of infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_aid_to_Palestinians)). SJP would have you believe that Hamas wants to ""decolonize"" Palestine and Oct 7 was ""resistance"". Israel is the ""[white](https://x.com/leekern13/status/1755005082251173942?t=HA2ns5E0pbNDCD3qLvnK7A)"" oppressor, and Palestine is the oppressed--a framework we are all too familiar with. We assume that Hamas wants coexistence, when their words and actions have shown the opposite.

The ""from the river to the sea"" chant was created in the 60s and has historically been used by Hamas among other groups as a call for the annihilation of Israel. A variation of the phrase in Arabic is [""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be Arab""](https://x.com/ShaiDavidai/status/1750264498038902849). Yet in the west we associate the phrase with Palestinian ""liberation"", a concept that we can relate to. Consider the absurdity of someone waving a swastika and arguing that it's a Buddhist symbol for good fortune. But this is essentially happening at colleges across the US, of course along with [intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada#:~:text='The%20Second%20Uprising'%3B%20Hebrew,Israel%20between%202000%20and%202005) chants.

In response to Pearl Harbor, we killed millions including nukes + many innocent civilians, in response to 9/11 we killed millions including innocents. Us population is roughly 350million. The October 7th attack on Israel killed 1,139 so roughly 4.8 times less than Pearl Harbor + 9/11.
Now when you consider Israel's population is 19million or 18.4 times less than americas we see if we multiply that
1,139 by 18.4 that would be the equivalent of 20,900
Americans dying or 3.8x Pearl Harbor and 9/11 combined.
And Israel has killed 30,000 Palestinians with a debatable but solid civilian to combatant death ratio of the data is believed. This is much better than the us would respond or many others. I'm not saying this makes it right to kill civilians, but war is war and it's weird for the USA to be protesting in the way it is to the far extent it has gone  .

Zionists claim that the Nakba was not an ethnic cleansing, and that the current assault on Gaza is not an ethnic cleansing.The united nations has described both as an ethnic cleansing. The definition of ethnic cleansing is forceful removal of a certain group from the land, which certainly describes the Nakba and Gaza. The Zionists commited several attacks on Palestenian villages and killed many people. This all played a role in their exit of the land.

The first prime minster of Israel even said that his goal was ethnic cleansing of the arabs:

[https://www.progressiveisrael.org/ben-gurions-notorious-quotes-their-polemical-uses-abuses/](https://www.progressiveisrael.org/ben-gurions-notorious-quotes-their-polemical-uses-abuses/)

&gt;5 October 1937, Ben-Gurion wrote in a letter to his 16 year old son Amos: “We must expel the Arabs and take their places…. And, if we have to use force-not to dispossess the Arabs of the Negev and Transjordan, but to guarantee our own right to settle in those places- then we have force at our disposal.”

“We walked outside, Ben-Gurion accompanying us. Allon repeated his question, What is to be done with the Palestinian population? ‘Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture which said ‘ Drive them out! ‘ “Yitzhak Rabin, leaked censored version of Rabin memoirs, published in the New York Times, 23 October 1979.

&gt;“We must do everything to insure they (the Palestinians) never do return.”

David Ben-Gurion, in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar’s Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 157.

In 1899 Zionists declared their goal to colonize palestine.

[https://www.nytimes.com/1899/06/20/archives/conference-of-zionists-elect-delegates-at-their-meeting-in.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1899/06/20/archives/conference-of-zionists-elect-delegates-at-their-meeting-in.html)

&amp;#x200B;

2. ZIonists claim that arabs have equal rights to jews in the land, and that for them this proves it is not apartheid. This is a lie from the zionists. Jews have a special right called the right to return, the right to return allows jews from any nation to get a free citizenship easily, and it even gives them a palestenians home that the person is still living in, this is known as settlers. The settlers could be from any country, but they not only get a citizenship but they are allowed to violently displace palestenians from a home they currently live in. There are many cases of this happening. OCHA reported, from 1 January to 19 September 2023, Israeli settlers and forces killed 189 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and wounded 8,192. This is not only legal but encouraged by the ISraeli government because it is meant to express their dominance.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\_settler\_violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settler_violence)

3. Zionists claim that Hamas is the only one at fault when any Palestenians die in the conflict. No matter what happens Zionists will never ever take any responsibility for any issues in this conflict. Their goal is to depict themselves as the civilized peaceful people, while Palestenians are the savages who refuse peace. They often do this by blaming Hamas for everything. The reality that Zionists will not tell you is that Hamas was irrelevant until the mid 2000s. They were not founded until late 1980s, and the group that they came out of had no military power. Israel saw them as a non threat to their goals, and they even decided to fund them because they thought itd be a powerful tactic against the more powerful groups.

Sources on ISrael funding Hamas: [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-borrell-says-israel-financed-creation-gaza-rulers-hamas-2024-01-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-borrell-says-israel-financed-creation-gaza-rulers-hamas-2024-01-19/)

[https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/)

The times of Israel even describes hamas as Netanyahus project.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/)

Thats why the people on this subreddit who are paid money to defend israel (becaause nobody would do that for free), will often use Hamas as the excuse for everything. Because the people that pay them obviously use the same rhetoric foundation that Netanyahu built which is to blame everything on hamas. Even though Hamas is a bunch of irrelevant random people with random weapons. Even if Hamas didnt exist somebody would aquire weapons to fight against the IDF.

The reality is that there is no hamas presence in the west bank, yet the people there live under Israels checkpoints and bullying by their IDF. You can read about it here, and other sources. [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/22/how-does-israels-occupation-of-palestine-work](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/22/how-does-israels-occupation-of-palestine-work)

Israel treats people a way in west bank, that will show you that this all has nothing do with Hamas. They treat people so poorly in the west bank that it shows that Hamas is clearly just an excuse to justify any action taken against Palestenians.

In fact Israel was fully aware of the attack coming on october 7th but chose to ignore it. This is likely because they wanted it to happen, and were happy to sacrifice their citizens for the sake of justifying a total destruction and ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html#:\~:text=Israeli%20officials%20obtained%20Hamas's%20battle,for%20Hamas%20to%20carry%20out](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html#:~:text=Israeli%20officials%20obtained%20Hamas's%20battle,for%20Hamas%20to%20carry%20out).

This is why their rhetoric after oct 7th was extremely aggressive, they thought that the attack would be easy to use to justify any actions against Gaza people. They thought western people would be very happy to support the destruction of Gaza because the october 7th. They were surpised to find that people did not like seeing babies and kids dying as a payback for this one attack.

Lastly its important to mention that Israel uses the Palestenians election of hamas to justify ethnic cleansing. Their argument is meant to conclude that because Palestenians support an evil group therefore they must all die. The problem is that this election took place almost 20 years ago, and a Majority of Palestenians alive today did not participate in this election!

5- Genocide, Zionists dont like this term, but the thing about a genocide is that there is a process. There are 10 recognized stages of genocide [https://museeholocauste.ca/en/resources-training/ten-stages-genocide/](https://museeholocauste.ca/en/resources-training/ten-stages-genocide/). I will be using these descriptions below:

1. Classification

Groups in a position of power will categorize people according to ethnicity, race, religion or nationality employing an us versus them mentality

This is certainly happening. For example the Israeli government described Palestenians as animals, and Netanyahu compared them to Amalek who were genocided in the bible. The south Africa case against Israel included many of these sorts of  statements, because they understand that Genocide begins with rhetoric, just like the Nazis started it that way. [https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/14/intent-in-the-genocide-case-against-israel-is-not-hard-to-prove](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/14/intent-in-the-genocide-case-against-israel-is-not-hard-to-prove)

.

*3. Discrimination*

*A dominant group uses laws, customs, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be granted full civil rights or even citizenship*.

The right to return being an exclusively jewish right is an example of discrimination. This lists 7 laws that discriminate between Israelis and Arabs.

[https://imeu.org/article/the-7-most-racist-israeli-laws](https://imeu.org/article/the-7-most-racist-israeli-laws)

1. The Jewish Nation-State Law

One of Israel’s quasi-constitutional Basic Laws. Stipulates that the right to self-determination in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories “is unique to the Jewish people” and encourages racial segregation and discrimination against Palestinians in housing by directing the state to promote the “development of Jewish settlement as a national value.”

2. The Law of “Return”

Gives Jews from anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and to automatically receive Israeli citizenship. At the same time, Israel denies indigenous Palestinians who were expelled during and after Israel’s establishment their legal right to return to their homeland because they aren’t Jewish and treats Palestinian citizens of the state, who comprise more than 20% of Israel’s population, as second-class citizens.

3. The Admissions Committee Law

Authorizes hundreds of smaller towns to set up “admissions committees” to reject applications from Palestinians, LGBTQ people, and others deemed undesirable using criteria such as being “unsuitable to the social life of the community… or the social and cultural fabric of the town.”

4. Absentee Property Law and Land Acquisition Law

Allows Israel’s government to expropriate land and other property belonging to Palestinians who were driven from their homes during the state’s establishment. The primary tool used by Israel to steal huge amounts of land and private property from Palestinians who were expelled and denied their right to return, including many internally displaced within Israel’s borders.

5. Israel Lands Law

Another of Israel’s quasi-constitutional Basic Laws. Stipulates that ownership of state lands can only be transferred between the government and quasi-governmental agencies like the Jewish National Fund, which only leases land to Jews. Ninety-three percent of the land in Israel is state owned. Israel's discriminatory land policies make it extremely difficult for Palestinians with Israeli citizenship to gain access to land for residential, commercial, agricultural, or other uses.

6. The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law

Prevents Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who are married to Palestinian citizens of Israel from gaining residency or citizenship status, including those who were expelled from towns inside what became Israel in 1948. Forces thousands of Palestinian citizens of Israel to leave the country or live apart from their spouses and families.

7. The Nakba Law

Bans public funding for institutions and organizations involved in commemorating the violent expulsion of three quarters of all Palestinians during Israel’s establishment as a Jewish-majority state in 1948, known to Palestinians as the “Nakba” (“catastrophe”).

Researchers have identified 65 laws which discriminate against arabs in Israel

[https://www.adalah.org/en/law/index](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/index)

The settlers taking peoples land is enough to prove apartheid.

*4. Dehumanisation*

*The diminished value of the discriminated group is communicated through propaganda. Parallels are drawn with animals, insects or diseases.*

I have shown you an example of Palestenians being compared to a disease and animals in the rhetoric.  Netanyahu also called Palestenian children the children of darkness. The South African case has brought many of these examples to the court.

*6. Polarisation*

*Propaganda is employed to amplify the differences between groups. Interactions between groups are prohibited, and the moderate members of the group in power are killed.*

There are examples of jews who oppose zionism and they are typically bullied by zionists.

*9. Extermination*

*The massacres begin. The perpetrators see their actions as “extermination” since they do not consider their victims to be entirely human.*

the indiscriminate bombing by israel

Zionists claim that Israel does not target civilians, but there is plenty of evidence of this happening. They almost excuseively target civilians. The United States themselves who fears Israel has critisized them for indiscriminate bombing. Meaning that they are not careful about who they are targeting.

Its important to note that there are some jews who were part of the Nazi army, and supported the Nazis. The idea that Arabi Israelis existence changes whether or not its genocide are apartheid is simply a debate tactic used by zionists.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-jew-who-worked-for-the-nazis-and-hunted-down-refugees-in-wwii-greece/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-jew-who-worked-for-the-nazis-and-hunted-down-refugees-in-wwii-greece/)

Some jews even participated in Nazi army.

&gt;With these facts in mind, most accept as common knowledge today that persons of Jewish descent were the most endangered people under Htler, and when considering the Nazi definition of who was a “full Jew,” they would be right. Yet, what many do not know is that probably several thousand Jews—and more than 150,000 “partial” Jews—served in the Wehrmacht, Germany’s military.

The michling were half jews, there were several that participated in the nazi party.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling)

&amp;#x200B;

You can imagine a typical argument from nazis being ""jews participated in the nazi army therefore it wasnt a genocide"".

6- Claims that the muslims want to genocide all jews. First of all jews lived in the muslim lands for over 1000 years. They lived all over the muslim lands in various different countries. Sometimes there may have been issues between them but for the most part Zionists will try to exaggerate this to justfiy their own genocides.

For example Jews had a golden age of culture in islamic spain. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden\_age\_of\_Jewish\_culture\_in\_Spain#:\~:text=The%20golden%20age%20of%20Jewish,cultural%2C%20and%20economic%20life%20flourished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain#:~:text=The%20golden%20age%20of%20Jewish,cultural%2C%20and%20economic%20life%20flourished).

SOme jews still live in the middle east today despite the fact that they could easily go live in Israel and take a palestenians home for free if they wanted, and get good benefits paid for by US tax payers.

In fact the Muslims were the ones who allowed the jews back into jerusalem. This is a fact that Zionists will never accept.

on page 71-72, The jewish historian gil Moshe, who wrote this history book in the 20th centruy says:

[https://ia600703.us.archive.org/24/items/AHistoryOfPalestine/A%20History%20of%20Palestine.pdf](https://ia600703.us.archive.org/24/items/AHistoryOfPalestine/A%20History%20of%20Palestine.pdf)

Similarly, his contemporary Salmon ben Yeru\]:lim, in his Arabic commentary toPs. xxx: wrote' ... as we know, th\*\*e temple remained in thehands of the Romans for more than 500 years and they did not succeed inenteringJerusalem; and anyone who did and was recognised \[as a Jew\] wasput to death. But when the Romans left it, by the mercy of the God ofIsrael, and the kingdom oflshmael was victorious, Israel was permitted tocome and to live ... '\*\*72\[84\] Until now we have seen that the Karaite commentators confirmwhat we know from the Christian sources, that it was forbidden to Jews toenter Jerusalem, **and they point out that the Muslims changed this situation when they captured the city.** The author of the 'Mysteries of RabbiShimon Bar Yo}:lai' also writes: 'The second king who will rise fromIshmael \[that is to say, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab\] will be a lover oflsrael andwill repair their cracks and the cracks of the temple'. AJewish chronicle, afragment of which is preserved in the Cairo Geniza, also confirms that itwas 'Umar who gave permission to the Jews to settle in Jerusalem and onthe basis of his decision seventy Jewish families came from Tiberias andsettled there.

So the muslims are the ones who allowed the jews back into Jerusalem after 500 years of exile, if islams goal was to genocide all jews like the zionists claim, then they certainly wouldnt lift a ban on their entry into their most important city. You can read on all of the conflict between jews and christians, the romans and the jews. They were not treated well by them for a very long time. According to muslim historians  from that period, the jews under roman occupation viewed the muslims as liberating them from the romans.

&amp;#x200B;

7-  I want to address the claim that israel is just defending themselves.

The first prime minster of Israel said :

“Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves … politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves… The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country. … Behind the terrorism \[by the Arabs\] is a movement, which though primitive is not devoid of idealism and self sacrifice.”

— David Ben Gurion. Quoted on pp 91-2 of Chomsky’s Fateful Triangle, which appears in Simha Flapan’s “Zionism and the Palestinians pp 141-2 citing a 1938 speech.

“We must do everything to insure they (the Palestinians) never do return.”

David Ben-Gurion, in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar’s Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 157.

“If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?”

David Ben-Gurion (the first Israeli Prime Minister): Quoted by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Jewish Paradox), pp121.

Its clear that you cannot be a conquerer while being the victim defending yourself. Its not defense if you are conquering other people. If you look at the [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-and-non-jewish-population-of-israel-palestine-1517-present](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-and-non-jewish-population-of-israel-palestine-1517-present) population growth of jews in Palestenine it grows because of the exlusion from europe. This caused conflict, and even though jews were only 30 percent of the population the united nations offered them over 60 percent of the land. Therefore the arabs declined because they were 68 percent of the population, so they thought it wasnt a fair deal to only recieve around 35 percent of the land. The zionists often use the rejection of ""peace"" as a way to depict Palestenians as savages who cant be dealt with. The reality is that the land they inhabited was going to be taken away from them, and it was a vast majority of the land. Not a fair or peaceful deal from their perspective. This is why people today often view Israel as merely an extension of british colonialism, because they were allied .

8. last thing I want to refute is the notion that Israelis are exclusively indegenous to the land. The reality is that Palestenians dna is indegenous to the land. It is very possible that some Palestenians ancestors may have been jews who converted to islam. There are many sources which confirm that Palestenian dna is not from saudi arabia like the Zionists claim. Therefore the claim that Zionists are exclusively indiegnous to the land is false.

The above is all I wanted to ask, but because of the mandatory character count, I will add some relevant ideas. What follows are my current beliefs, for context. 

All my beliefs (except item 5) are subject to change. If you feel that I am incorrect or misinformed, please let me know.

1. I think Israel has a legitimate reason to be at war with Hamas.

2. I believe the IDF is truthful when it states that it is doing all it can to minimize civilian casualties while simultaneously attempting to eradicate a threat.

3. I believe most Hamas militants did not differentiate between civilian and soldier on 7 October. (I have heard otherwise, but do not believe those claims.)

4. In terms of gross numbers, the IDF has killed many more more innocent Palestinians than Hamas has killed innocent Israelis.

5. Each innocent life is equivalent, whether Palestinian or Israeli.

6. Although the number of innocent Palestinians killed by IDF is greater than number of innocent Israelis killed by Hamas, there is no moral equivalence to the killers themselves. This is because of (2) and (3).

7. I believe the ""Nakba"" was unfair to many Palestinians. I understand the desire to return.

8. I believe Israel has the right to exist.

9. I believe the reason Israel limits and controls Palestinian movement (of people and goods) across its border is for security and not to anger or frustrate Palestinians.

It seems to me that this concept - or rather this word - seems to be one of the major points of contention and misunderstanding because it seems to mean very different things depending on who you ask.

Me myself as a British Jew, my grandparents would most certainly call themselves Zionists, to them this simply meant the belief that a Jewish state is a necessity in order to prevent another holocaust (they were of the generation who grew up during and after the holocaust so naturally their outlook was shaped by that). My granddad in particular was a dedicated Zionist and owned Herzl's books though he apparently simply liked living in London too much to ever consider moving to Israel, like other members of his family did.

I would not describe him or most other older Jews who describe themselves as Zionists as hateful people, not even towards Palestinians. Although attacks by Palestinian groups on Israelis and diaspora Jews did upset them very much and they would be angry towards specific groups like Hamas - but I never remember them having any actual hatred towards Palestinians or Muslims themselves and living in London they interacted and talked with Muslims with no problem at all. If they were guilty of anything it was ignorance of the impact that the creation of Israel had had on the Palestinians which I think if they truly understood would probably have a more nuanced view on why the conflict was happening.

I am aware there are people in the Jewish community who are just hateful to Muslims and Palestinians, but I wouldn't count my grandparents as such, in their case their Zionism did not mean being hateful to anyone. They did not seem to be a fan of the more right wing and fanatical form of Zionism which characterises Israeli politics today and thought it was ''a group of stupid people with war fantasies''.

However, when I see the word Zionism used nowadays online or by pro-palestine protesters, Im not sure what they mean when they say it or what they have in mind. Zionism to them seems to mean a form of racism or some sort of Jewish supremacy which implies hatred and a desire to hurt or kill Palestinians or other groups- I don't fault people for thinking this but it doesn't really apply to my grandparents or most other Jewish people I've known who would call themselves 'zionist' and I don't really believe they deserve to be hated.

Sometimes when people use the word 'zionism' it does just confuse me a lot, my main worry concerning this is that people's vague definitions of Zionism are being confused with things which are just ordinary Jewish things like saying ''next year in Jerusalem'' or visiting the Western Wall or even observing Hannukah. To me this is where anti-zionism becomes anti-semitism but I dont think everyone who says such things are doing so out of a genuine hatred of Jews but out of misunderstanding.

In 2014, Frieman wrote:

&gt; When Hamas’s leaders surveyed their assets before this summer’s round of fighting, they knew that among those assets was the international press. The AP staff in Gaza City would witness a rocket launch right beside their office, endangering reporters and other civilians nearby—and the AP wouldn’t report it, not even in AP articles about Israeli claims that Hamas was launching rockets from residential areas. (This happened.) Hamas fighters would burst into the AP’s Gaza bureau and threaten the staff—and the AP wouldn’t report it. (This also happened.) Cameramen waiting outside Shifa Hospital in Gaza City would film the arrival of civilian casualties and then, at a signal from an official, turn off their cameras when wounded and dead fighters came in, helping Hamas maintain the illusion that only civilians were dying. (This too happened; the information comes from multiple sources with firsthand knowledge of these incidents.)

Separately, Friedman personally recalls an AP story about Hamas dressing in civilian clothing in Gaza that was squashed after Hamas threats to AP journalists in Gaza. The story was never reported.

In this same way, i don’t believe that anti-Islamism is Islamophobic. I think the problem is that anti-Zionist and anti-Islamist movements invariably do give shelter to Antisemites or Islamophobes. Either accepting them willfully, or ushering them in unwittingly. To say that the entire pro-Palestine movement is purely anti-Zionist, with no trace of antisemitism, you’d have to be brain dead. And vice versa. It’s all in plain view. I think that supporting one side of this conflict 100% with no holds barred requires willful ignorance and self deception.

My views on this particular war are probably more in line with the pro-Palestine’s. But you will never find me marching next to some idiot with a Hamas headband. And due to the fact that I am in favor of Israel’s right to exist, I might even be chased out if that were to be revealed.

li9bp5g,3,"&gt; I explicitly and repeatedly said that I already know Hamas uses human shields.

Then why do you keep asking for examples whenever people point it out, instead of actually engaging with the discussion they are trying to have with you, which you yourself literally invited above?

&gt; Of course Hamas also use human shields, so that may well be a valid point to bring up in any discussion, though it's a slightly different type.

Yet, when I brought this up, as you stated was valid for me to do, you shut me down by claiming it has nothing to do with the IDF's crime and that I was just angry at people for not condemning Hamas enough.

&gt; My issue here is that you would like to take a discussion of Israeli transgressions, and replace it with a discussion of double standards. I would like to discuss the actual topic itself that I made the thread about.

The discussion of Hamas using human shields *is* a discussion about double standards in how we talk about IDF versus Hamas crimes. That *is* the discussion, which you above stated you wanted to have, and are now backtracking when people have it.

&gt; Please at least try to read my posts before replying.

The problem is, your posts are contradictory. You claim to not deny that Hamas does this, but whenever people bring it up in rational discussion, you shut it down with ""well show us the evidence."" Well, the dude showed you the evidence. 

Not once have you ever actually given us any reason to believe that you agree (with the *evidence*) that Hamas has a far more egregious habit of utilizing human shields, civilian combatants and child soldiers than does Israel - and  that people across the board fail to acknowledge this while acting like Israel doing it is the absolute worst thing that has ever happened.

You dismissed it by saying an in-depth 24-page report spanning over a decade, indicating deep-rooted strategy on behalf of this actor, was akin to a picture of a carrot, and that repeatedly said that pointing out the parallels between these two organizations is the exact same as forcing you to repeat ""*I condemn Hamas*"" over and over again like r/CatsStandingUp. 

At this point it is blatantly obvious that you are not interested in having an actual conversation about any of this. If *you* wanted to post a thread about how awful the IDF is and how miserable and terrible Israelis are whilst forbidding any discussion of Hamas's equivalent crimes, *you* could have just done that.

The article links to another article [here](https://archive.is/yERCA) that references Al Jazeera footage showing Israeli forces doing this:

&gt;&gt;""In the video, soldiers are seen attaching body cameras to handcuffed detainees and even dressing them in uniforms and protective vests before sending them into destroyed buildings and even the entrances of tunnels, in order to guarantee that the areas have not been rigged with explosives, before the soldiers enter.""

...

&gt;&gt;""In one of the videos, a detainee was heard calling into a tunnel, in Arabic, saying that the IDF controls the area, in what appears to be an attempt to persuade anyone hiding inside to turn themselves in.""

Haaretz spoke to soldiers in their own investigation and say:

&gt;&gt;""""Our lives are more important than their lives,"" soldiers were told. The thinking is that it's better for the Israeli soldiers to remain alive and for the shawishim to be the ones blown up by an explosive device.
&gt;&gt;This description is one of many obtained by Haaretz, some from combat soldiers, others from commanders. The picture that emerges: In recent months, Israeli soldiers have used human shields in this way all over Gaza; even the chief of staff's office knows.""

For context:

&gt;&gt;""The soldiers call each of them a shawish, an obscure Arabic word of Turkish origin meaning sergeant""

The investigation doesn't try to precisely quantify the scale of it (which I expect would be possible), so it's not completely obvious whether this has happened hundreds of times or in just a handful of cases one of which happened to be filmed. But the investigation suggests it was (and perhaps still is) commonplace:

&gt;&gt;""Soldiers choose Gazans for the missions and bring them to the brigades and battalions operating in the Strip. ""There is pride in it,"" said a source who took part in some of the ""locating"" work.
&gt;&gt;""The senior ranks know about it,"" the source said. The army has played innocent despite footage shown on Al Jazeera about two months ago. Israeli soldiers can be seen dressing Palestinian detainees in uniforms and flak jackets, putting cameras on them and sending them into badly damaged houses and tunnel entrances with their hands bound by plastic ties.""

Of course, this isn't the first time Israel have been accused of doing this. There was the disputed incident a few months back where they strapped a wounded guy to the front of a car and the IDF said they was ""against protocol"". There have also been several previous allegations of its use in this conflict, as well as in the West Bank since the conflict began, including a [UN report claiming to have verified](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/11/un-report-violations-against-children-gaza-west-bank-israel) five separate instances of the IDF using Palestinians as human shields since Oct 7th.

Interestingly, and perhaps for some surprisingly, this practice was only actually [outlawed in Israel in 2005](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/07/israel), when the Israeli Supreme Court ruled it was against Israeli law. The IDF at the time appealed on the grounds that they considered it a valuable tactic but didn't overturn the ruling. Since then there have been [sporadic allegations](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-report-accuses-israeli-forces-of-using-palestinian-children-as-human-shields-abusing-children-in-custody/) of its continuing use, but the Israeli legal system has made at least some attempt to clamp down on it, one example being a case in 2010 where two IDF staff sergeants were demoted and [given suspended prison sentences](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/21/israeli-soldiers-human-shield-avoid-jail) for forcing a 9-year-old Palestinian to open bags they suspected contained explosives.

Quick caveat - the IDF distinguished the use of human shields from a specific practice they called the ""neighbour procedure"", whereby they would send a Palestinian ""volunteer"" into buildings with suspected militants to try to convince them to go outside to be arrested. This was specifically mentioned as also being banned by the Supreme Court, but according to B'tSelem the practice has continued and allegations are very rarely investigated.

In summary - Israel have by various accounts used human shields in this conflict. The extent isn't well known, but it's been caught on video, alleged by the UN, and alleged by whistleblowers within Israel as reported in Israeli media.

What do people think of the practice? What are people's suspicions of the extent, as to whether it was/is widespread or a rare exception? Do people think it's likely that Israel will investigate thoroughly, prosecute and ultimately convict any offenders caught having done it? Are leadership likely to have encouraged it, known about it, attempted to stop it, or been unaware because it was done in secret, deniably, or on a small enough scale to go under the radar? Can any of these alleged incidents be disproven, or perhaps argued to have been in compliance with Israeli or international law? 

Should the morality of the practice be judged in the deontological sense of ""crossing a line"", a utilitarian sense of the IDF believing themselves to be acting to save the most Israeli lives as possible in a conflict they didn't start, or a consequentialist sense of only being something to condemn if it can be shown to have lead to Palestinian deaths or injury? If it had caused the latter, could we expect this information to ever be made public?

Of course Hamas also use human shields, so that may well be a valid point to bring up in any discussion, though it's a slightly different type. They're typically alleged (convincingly, to be clear) to place civilians in buildings or to locate their assets in buildings with civilians as a way to discourage attacks whereas the IDF are alleged to move around with civilians in front of them, or to force civilians to investigate for traps or negotiate with militants. We don't seem to have much detail on the frequency of either side doing it, but by all means compare if you have a way of doing so, let's not try to isolate the IDF's transgressions or wave away talk of Hamas' crimes as whataboutery in this case.

So to start off I support Palestine, I’ve gathered some informations these past few months and no offense but it’s so obvious to me that Israel is evil that I just wonder how could one support such a state. 

As I wanna get your point of view I have some questions that I hope some people will be willing to answer :

1 - Is Hamas actually antisemite ? I’ve watched two videos on youtube in which it is explained that basically the reason it is believed Hamas is antisemite is because of its religious identity. Also it’s been founded to oppose the israeli occupation, don’t you think it’s just a normal reaction for a colonized nation to try and fight back against it ? I’d also like to know your opinions on the intifadas. How can Palestine possibly be wrong in this ? 

2 - What Israel did and is still doing, the very core of its foundation is colonization, right ? Why in your opinions is the state allowed practice it ? Is Israel holding Gaza people imprisoned inside the strip ? If so why is that right ? 

3 - Do you support the actions of the IDF/IOF, since the Nakba and october 7th. I’m talking of all the bombings of hospitals and different other infrastructures as well as the attacking of civilians, the 30k+ palestinians killed since oct 7. 

4 - I’m sorry for the lives that were lost on october 7th, both on Israelis and Palestinians side, but in my opinion it was just self defense and Hamas fighting back the occupation it is being a victim of since 1948. Can you explain to me why I’m wrong ?

For reference: Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib (a Gazan and pro-Palestine activist) [comments on Twitter about Secretary Blinken's recent interview](https://twitter.com/afalkhatib/status/1875765202731532455)

""The ""pro-Palestine"" movement's role in prolonging the war on Gaza: Though many are angry with Secretary Blinken’s responses during his interview with the New York Times about Gaza, some of the points he shared are absolutely salient and accurate. I have said this time and again and received immense backlash for doing so: Hamas’s war strategy, statements, behavior, and goals regularly shift and oscillate based on international public opinion, the actions of the “pro-Palestine” solidarity movement, and political statements by world governments, leaders, and institutions against Israel’s war. To be clear, I’m not in any capacity saying I endorse the horrendous war that Israel’s been waging on Gaza, killing a large number of civilians (including my family) and failing to achieve strategic and lasting results 15 months later.

However, Hamas refused to engage in pragmatic negotiations to end the war it started, pulled back several times from closing a ceasefire/hostage deal, and thought that mass civilian casualties would delegitimize Israel and force it to end the war. Many are uncomfortable with Secretary Blinken’s remarks because he shed light on the reality that “pro-Palestine” rhetoric and pressure on Israel has inevitably or perhaps indirectly resulted in a strengthening of Hamas’s position and the overall worsening of the situation for Palestinians in Gaza.

I have said time and again that even if folks wanted to attack and criticize Israeli actions, they should call upon the Islamist group to release hostages and negotiate and off-ramp from the war to implement political transformation. Instead, the “pro-Palestine” and international solidarity movements completely ignored Hamas’s criminality against Palestinians and Israelis alike while failing to promote pragmatic, realistic pathways forward to save the most Palestinian lives and make it clear that Hamas’s actions are unpopular, unsupported, and condemned.

**Secretary Blinken is right on the money with his remarks. The “pro-Palestine” movements across the world after October 7 bear a significant responsibility for prolonging this war and directly contributing to the massive suffering of Palestinians in the coastal enclave. This dereliction of duty delegitimizes almost the entirety of the premise upon which current “pro-Palestine” activism is built. Take a step back and never, ever speak for, over, or on behalf of the Palestinian people!**",Pro-Palestine movement actually makes things worse for Palestinians,0.74,160,0,2025-01-06 16:00:30

My point is for a population of 3 million the amount actually harmed by settlers is statistically insignificant and the overall rate of violence there is lower then most of the developed world with a VAST majority of it being Muslim terrorism.

We were talking about the war, and she told me that even though (in her opinion) the one-state solution is the most moral one, it's also doomed to failure. Why? Because we already have an example of a multi-ethnic, secular, Middle Eastern state: Lebanon. And Lebanon is (in her words) a clusterfuck. It's a complete mess of sectarianism, violence and corruption that thrives on the divisions between ethniticies and religions.

She also told me that, unlike in Canada, there is very little actual inter-ethnic mixing in Lebanon. Most people keep to their own sect. There's very little intermarriage. There's a lot of racism, especially against foreigners. Friend groups are usually composed of people from the same religion/ethnicity. It's not the type of multicultural, peaceful utopia that the far-left seems to think will happen in a one-state Palestine/Israel.

So for all those calling for a one-state solution, you have a very obvious example of what it will look like. Lebanon. Is this any better than a 2-state-solution?



P.S. The type of 2-state solution I envision is one in which any settlement that hinders an easily defensible, logical Israel-Palestine border is removed. I think that an agreement that relates the number of settlers that need to be relocated to the amount of Palestinian refugees allowed to claim right of return (to Israel proper) would be a rational way to achieve this. Basically, if 100 000 settlers need to be relocated, then 100 000 Palestinian refugees can claim right of return. In this way, the demographic balance of Israel would remain unchanged (something Israelis want) and Palestinians get more of their land back (something Palestinians want). I know this is probably a very controversial proposal, but it honestly seems like one of the few ways to make the 2SS work. My friend has a much more cynical outlook: she basically thinks that the Middle East is doomed and that there's always going to be war there, no matter what happens.

There is Hamas- a terrorist group who regularily attacks Israel and said that Oct 7 was a ""Dress Rehearsal"" and openly say they want Sharia Law globally. They terrorize their own people, have been show destroying the aid coming in and emphatically are the ones oppressing the Palestinians. 

There are Palestinian civilians who would probably be moderate and just want to live a normal and safe life.

There are Israeli Extremists who support Netenyahu blindly and are hyper religious and right wing. These people are still more alligned with Western values than Hamas.

And there are Israeli moderates/left who want to live in their ancestral homeland, feel for the Palestinian civilians etc. 

Hamas, universally, is immoral and wrong. They bastardize the Koran, they commit atrocities each day in and out in Palestine and need to be eliminated. They hold down the rest of the Palestinian population. They literally call for the murder of all Israelis, then the Jews and then the West. There is nothing to support there from Western values. 

They literally raped women while shooting them dead. They are on video playing with a breast they chopped off a living woman like a hackysack before murdering her. They raped men even though they are homophobic. They murdered families by setting them on fire. They commit torture as part of everyday life. 

But they also throw their own civilians off buildings for being gay. Women are stoned to death in the street. They are a horrific terrorist group directly controlled and funded by Iran.

Why is the world not globally against this? 

I am a moderate Zionist in Canada. I think after this, yes Netenyahu should be tried and put in jail. But fact is Hamas attacked first in the most brutal and heinous manner. The goal of IDF is clear- to get back the hostages who have been abused and raped in dark tunnels for more than half a year and destroy the terrorists. To question that intent is insane! 

And as shown historically, and in their own plan, Israel will still rebuild Gaza. They have sent in plenty of aid that is stolen by Hamas and she. are stuffed to the gills, literally pissed on and stomped on so the citizens can't use it. They continue to provide clean water. Every attack is prefaced by warnings in every way possible to protect civilians. But Hamas threatens them to listen. 

Yet somehow, Isreal is seen as the bad guy and even blamed for Hamas existence. The only difference? Israel is the JEWISH state...

However, if the goal is to illegally invade and occupy more Palestinian land and to expand Israel just like they did in 1967, then it makes perfect sense.

&gt; Hamas became the de facto authority in Gaza shortly after Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005. The following year, Hamas won a majority of seats in the PA’s legislature and formed a government. It earned votes for the social services it provided and as a rejection of the incumbent Fatah, which many voters perceived as having grown corrupt at the helm of the PLO and delivering little to Palestinians through its negotiations with Israel. The outcome was unacceptable to Fatah and its Western backers, and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. In Gaza, Hamas routed Fatah’s militias in a week of fighting, resulting in a political schism between the two Palestinian territories. Palestinians have not voted for a legislature since 2006, nor a president since 2008.

I am pro Palestine in many ways. I have been an activist on the left almost my entire life. 

However, the events on October 7th shocked me. The brutality was hard to comprehend. But equally hard to comprehend was the reaction by the left. 

I immediately began seeing posts that focused only on crimes committed by Israel. I immediately saw posts downplaying the tragedy, before Israel had even responded. 

I saw NO posts on the left, giving space to those mourning to grieve. And as Israel mounted its offensive (which I am equally critical of) I would see five minute long condescending tirades about why activists shouldn’t have to condemn Hamas, or the attacks on October 7th, rather than just saying loss of life is a tragedy.

If you want peace, why is it so hard to denounce the violence committed by Hamas? Why is it like pulling teeth? 
Do you think it helps anything at all ripping down posters of those kidnapped?

Why can’t both the loss of life in Palestine and Israel be treated as a loss of humanity? The people killed by Hamas were innocent.

In fact, as an Iranian, I saw many parallels between their situation &amp; that of the Iranian people. 

Fast forward to 2022, when the woman life freedom uprisings occurred. I had to unfollow every last pro-Palestine page because they either spread pro regime propaganda, or re-told the history, or made up some other egregious lies. Under every post about Iran, the main people speaking against us were Palestinians &amp; their supporters. 

Even then, when the pro-Palestine movement started “trending” in October, I stood with the Palestinians. I attended protests, I made posts, followed all the pro-Palestine people I could find, &amp; supported the movement. It was precisely this that made me discover an EXTENSIVE network of Islamic republic organizations propelling &amp; fueling the protests, movements, &amp; actions for Palestine. I noticed that the people I was marching &amp; working alongside where proud regime supporters. When they found out my views, some would ostracize me, &amp; others would tone down their views — in a, “we won’t tell you we support the regime so you still help us get where we want, but we will be supporting your oppressors at every step of the way” type of way. 

I think my wake up call was coming around December, when people were proudly supporting the Houthis. Houthis have a much more direct connection to the Islamic republic than Hamas does (or at least I believe so), so that was a huge red flag. It got worse and worse. Support for Hezbollah, support for IRGC, &amp; so on.

That’s when I realized how much of an idiot I’d been. I was getting my news on Palestine from regime organizations (which are NEVER to be believed), I was following regime-backed organizations, &amp; I was in solidarity with literal regime supporters. 

Yes, war crimes &amp; human rights violations are occurring &amp; they must be stopped. However, I believe there are two pro-Palestine movements. One is rooted in genuine human rights &amp; justice &amp; peace in Israel-Palestine, the other one is the Islamic republic’s ideology. The latter has gone mainstream. And just like the regime destroyed Syria, &amp; Lebanon, &amp; Yemen, this “pro Palestine” movement, led by Hamas, is how they’re destroying Palestine and putting it on a path they cannot come back from. But unfortunately, I don’t see any considerable awareness of this among Palestinians or their allies. There are some voices, yes, but they’re the ones pushed to the margins &amp; ostracized. When the time comes for real change in Palestine, it is the radicals, the terrorists, &amp; the unethical people who will take power, enabled by the ignorance of the well-intentioned public. Reminds me of 1979 in Iran. 

Knowing what I know now, I’m so deeply resentful when I see a Palestine supporter, or people who naively join the cause. They have no idea what they’re actually supporting. And those of us who try to point it out are harassed &amp; bullied into silence. 

Edit: adding this — a lot of Americans joined the cause over the last 9 months. I generally had high hopes for them, thinking they’re motivated by human rights. So I’d tell them about Iran. I’d talk of the gender apartheid, how they assassinate &amp; kidnap dissidents abroad, how they’ve destroyed Syria, the fact that Hezbollah &amp; Assad regularly bomb Yarmouk, one of the largest Palestinian refugee camps in the world located in Syria. For all their stories about “collective liberation,” how we can all be “free,” how we should “educate ourselves about the world,” I thought they’d care. I thought they’d be outraged. That they’d extend solidarity. That of the 25 infographics they posted every day (most of which were egregious propaganda), they’d find it in themselves to share even 1 post about Iran, or Syria, or add this context into discussions of a region they’d discovered only months prior. But it was crickets. They were unmoved. They didn’t care. In fact, they posted in FAVOUR of Hezbollah. They defended the regime. They said, “still though, the west sucks for opposing them.” And that’s when I realized that supporting these people and their movement defies all logic. I mean, it’s Islamic republic-backed &amp; influenced, it treats us Iranians as its “collateral damage” (or frankly anyone they don’t view as “oppressed by the west”), &amp; it will create a world extremely, extremely worse than today. Why on earth would I get behind that when I know better? 

Edit 2: just because you refuse to believe that not everyone follows your narrow worldview, that people change their minds, &amp; that pro-regime sentiments is a core feature of this movement, doesn’t make it all “go away” or make me hasbara/a bot.

Never identified as a “Zionist” but I’m in the two state solution camp.  I have never been a fan of Israel, but I’m also critical of my own country for similar reasons.  I hate capitalism and occupation in general, and I hate that both countries displaced large groups of people in their creation.

I have been trying to process the world’s reaction to October 7th.  I have watched the footage and it’s horrifying.  It’s sad hearing people either call it a good thing or say it didn’t happen.  It’s sad seeing people glorifying Hamas.  It hurts to see people glorifying a group that is ultimately against Jewish people (not interested in debating the 2017 charter, that was for entirely diplomatic reasons).

I would consider myself somewhat well read on middle eastern history in the 20th-21st century.  This is due to needing to understand why so many people have turned to hateful antisemitism.  I really see a lot of parallels with Hamas and Isis.  I think some people see westernism as a cancer on our world.  Growing up with antisemitism and being a victim of a hate crime, I have felt this “otherness” before, this alienation from western society.  I could see how extreme hatred of America could lead to someone wanting to join a group that promises it’s destruction.  I look at people who eat up DPRK or Russian propaganda solely because it’s “not American.”

It hurts that an act like 9/11 was universally condemned, and united a country against Al Qaeda, but it’s treated so differently when it happens to a Jewish country.  Western imperialism hurt many people in the Middle East and around the world, and Israel’s actions hurt many Palestinians.  But what of civilians?  Why do I hear people say that everyone should be a target?  Why is it okay to hate an entire country, instead of a country’s government?

So because of today’s climate, I wonder if people would react differently to 9/11.  Would they see it as an act of resistance?  Would they condemn it while hypocritically supporting Hamas?  Would they say that all Americans are a target because of the US government being complicit in many bad things?",How do you think modern Americans would react to 9/11 if it happened today?,0.76,45,0,2024-09-06 05:05:11

All of OP's examples where people were injured or killed started as ""non violent"" and then became riots that turned very violent. 

This is the typical narrative of the pro-palestinian crowd where they claim everything is peaceful, because it starts out that way, and then turn a complete blind eye to the violence that follows.. much like the pro-palistinian narrative of events like the great ""march of return"".  

There's an Islamic doctrine similar to the more known Taqqiyah, that is called Tawriya, where using half truths to create a false impression, or lies by omission. While I'd assume most people don't know what it is or called, this still seems to be a very widely used tactic by Palestinian propaganda efforts.

**1) Non-violent Protests and Demonstrations**

Some of the most common non-violent Palestinian resistance actions media are protests and demonstrations. These happen almost on a weekly basis both in the West Bank and Gaza. Sadly, most not only end up in failure, injuries or deaths but you won't normally hear this in the media. Some examples,

March 30th, 1976: Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Arab Israeli citizens of Israel take part in strikes and nonviolent demonstrations in response to the Israeli government’s plan to expropriate 60,000 dunams of Palestinian-owned land in the Galilee. Six protestors were killed as a result of Israeli gun fire. To commemorate this incident, Palestinians observe Land Day every year as a day for action and protest.

[https://www.jpost.com/features/in-thespotlight/this-week-in-history-the-1976-land-day-protests](https://www.jpost.com/features/in-thespotlight/this-week-in-history-the-1976-land-day-protests)

17 October 2010, in the Palestinian village of Budrus, villagers held 55 peaceful demonstrations over 10 months in defiance of the Israeli expansion of settlements and the the West Bank barrier headed by the Palestinian non-violent advocate, Issa Amro

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11555031](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11555031)

October 25th, 2022. Hundreds of people took to the streets early this morning in several cities to protest the Israeli military assault on the northern West Bank city of Nablus that left four Palestinians dead and 21 injured, including four critical, and calls were made for a general strike today in Nablus.

[https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/131505](https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/131505)

Of course, this only barely scratches the surface of the tons of peaceful non-violent demonstrations held every year in the West Bank. Banners, demonstrations, protests, against settlement expansion and against the barrier that separates Palestinian West Bank communities with each other all are daily occurences but sadly the media and the world either ignores or rarely takes heed of these event. It's not hard to see why. Demonstrations aren't that flashy enough to attract attention and grab the media's focus but I think that's precisely what makes these acts of non-violent resistance unique. They aren't going to attract the world's attention, they aren't going to be the headline in a CNN or Fox News article, they aren't going to be the thing that galvanizes international support around the world.

Yet despite all this (plus the almost non-effectiveness) of such actions, some Palestinians still hold firm and committed to these acts of non-violence in the name of peace and reconciliation. There's more to be said here, but I'll continue down below. Non-violent demonstrations and protests are just one, out of a dozen ways Palestinians have used to peacefully resist.

**2) Tax Strikes.**

In 1989, during the First Intifada, the Palestinian resistance (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, UNLU) and Ghassan Andoni and Kamel Danoun, urged people to stop paying taxes to Israel, which inherited and modified the previous Jordanian tax-collection regime in the West Bank. **""No taxation without representation,""** said a statement from the organizers. The people of Beit Sahour responded to this call with an organized citywide [tax strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_resistance) that included refusal to pay and file tax returns.

The quoted slogan is reminiscent of the American resistance to British imperialism and defiance against oppressive British tax policies. I think the notion of taxation WITH representation should be a notion and ideal close to many people around the world, especially to those in America and the Western liberal democratic world.

Tax resistance, or the refusal to pay tax because of opposition to the government that is imposing the tax, or to government policy, or as opposition to taxation in itself has been commonly used around the world as a form of peaceful resistance and opposition to oppressive policies. It's not something unique and rare around the world. The adoption of this by the Palestinians of Beit Sahour marks another example of how people can peacefully resist against oppression and tyranny through non-violent means to achieve peace and justice

**3) The ""White Intifada"" of 2010**

In 2010, A ""White Intifada"" took hold in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Activities included weekly peaceful protests by Palestinian activists accompanied by Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem and Israeli academics and students against settlers and security forces. The EU, through its foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton has criticised Israel for convicting an organiser of the peaceful movement.

While the term ""Intifada"" usually has negative connotations in Israeli society, that doesn't always have to be the case. Intifada literally means to a rebellion, uprising, revolt, or resistance. It is not that is by itself, violent or bloody. There are certainly many ways revolts and uprising have been bloodless and peaceful all throughout history. So many examples to choose from the Americas to Europe and the Middle East. The ""White Intifada"" or mass protests and demonstrations against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is no different. A large group of people non-violently demonstrating against oppression, united in solidarity and common ideals is exactly what a well-led organized non-violent form of resistance should look like. Sadly, most people don't know about this chapter in the history of Palestinian resistance, and it is often overshadowed by the First and Second Intifadas, which were far more violent and bloody. Like I said before, non-violent acts of resistance aren't flashy and don't always get the world's and the media's attention.

One more thing I'd like to add, when Gandhi was peacefully demonstrating against the British occupation over India, he was tried and sentenced to prison for ""inciting sedition"" just like how all these ""Palestinian Gandhis"" were arrested and detained by Israel. Some pro-Israelis might look at all these arrests as justified for breaking the law, yet do you say the same thing about Gandhi's arrest? Were the British in the right to arrest Gandhi for disturbing the order and inciting sedition against the ruling British class? Was Gandhi in the wrong for trying to peacefully fight back and liberate his homeland from British rule?

**In summary:** Here are just a few examples of Palestinian non-violent resistance that have been tried in the past and continue to be enacted even in the present day. While the media and most people focus on Hamas and the PIJ, this ignores the wider context in which Palestinians have also tried non-violent means to resist occupation.

This isn't even getting into legitimate forms of resistance such as targeting IDF military targets and military vehicles. Stone-throwing against IDF soldiers or slapping IDF soldiers is not illegal. According to the charter for human rights and international law, occupied people have the right to resist even with armed methods, as long as it conforms to the law and international standard.

My goal is to only show a few such examples of Palestinian non-violent resistance actions, both for those who never knew about them and for those that falsely accuse the Palestinians of never trying peaceful non-violent means. At the very least, I hope this post inspires people to go out and search for themselves what the Palestinians have gone through and what they have done to confront it.

Lastly, I have a question for pro-Israeli supporters out there. Many of them rightfully critique and condemn Palestinians when they stab or shoot innocent Israeli civilians, yet here we have examples of those who pursued a more peaceful path. Any number of them could've have joined Hamas, launched suicide bombings, or stab civilians. Yet they chose a different path. Despite that, Israel continues to detain and incarcerate them under administrative detention where abuse and violence is rife.

Question: If you were a Palestinian, what would you have done? How would you peacefully resist in such a way that doesn't get you arrested by Israel? All of the above I mentioned have and continue to be arrested and detained by Israel. **How would you have done so without getting into trouble??**

Second, if you saw your peaceful non-violent means led to little or nothing at all, would you still keep to them or try a different method? If yes, how would you propose to do so without being called a terrorist? When Palestinians stab an IDF soldier, a legitimate military target under the LOAC, they are called violent terrorists. **If you were to choose the path of legitimate armed resistance, how would you do so without being called a terrorist, but as a freedom fighter?** As the saying goes, ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"".

For as long as I have observed this conflict and those involved from both sides of the conflict, no matter what the Palestinians do, they will always get labeled as ""terrorists"". Shooting and stabbing an IDF soldier in the West Bank? That's terrorism. Throwing rocks against IDF soldiers and IDF military vehicles (all perfectly legitimate military targets under the LOAC), that's terrorism. Peacefully organizing a non-violent demonstration against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank? That's terrorism? Pro-Israelis condemn and get mad when Palestinians shoot and stab innocent Israeli civilians. When Palestinians change their targets and attack legitimate IDF military soldiers, you call that ""terrorism"". **You want the Palestinians to peacefully non-violently resist. When they do that, you accuse them of breaking the law. You want the Palestinians to only attack legitimate military targets. When they do as you say, you call them ""terrorists"".**

**TLDR:** So what do you want the Palestinians to do??? To pro-Israelis, show me a way that isn't ""terrorism"" by your definition and doesn't get you arrested or in trouble with Israel. No matter what the Palestinians try, it seems to be all wrong according to your perspective. If you're really anti-occupation and believe in the LOAC, suggest a way for the Palestinians to peacefully non-violent resist against occupation that isn't wrong by your standards.",Palestinian non-violent resistance,0.64,46,0,2024-09-03 10:43:02
lxxzto1,2,Declaring that some group of people have lost thier human qualities and you can loose it to by contact with them sound quite racist.,Palestine,2024-11-19 16:00:28,1guteol,cyrkielNT,0,2,0,True,2019-01-23 05:08:56,40.0,0.0,350.0,55292.0,55682.0,1885,"Neil Druckmann himself has admitted the game is an allegory for Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Seraphites as stand-ins for Palestinians and WLF for Israel. He admitted this before the game was even released.

Link for proof: https://www.vice.com/en/article/bv8da4/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii

1- The Palestinian stand-in in his game are insane deranged psychopaths. The game claims to be ""showing all sides"" but the Seraphites are just shown as unhinged crazy people and the only 2 ""good"" seraphites in the game side with Abby, the IDF stand-in.

2- Saying ""I'm not racist, I like this one trans Palestinian"" is called pinkwashing or rainbow imperialism. It's just justifying genocide using progressive sounding words. The character of Lev serves no point other than to portray Palestinians collectively as backwards anti-LGBT people.

3- ""Cycle of Violence"" is bullshit shitlib framing. The reason violence never ends in Palestine is that Israel is a settler colonial state whose mission statement is to eradicate Palestinians from their own land. ""Cycle of Violence"" makes it out to be some kind of misunderstanding and that Palestinians keep getting killed because they can't just ""forgive and forget"". There is nothing for Palestinians to ""forget"", the ethnic cleansing and their oppression is an ongoing process that happens daily in their lives, not something that happened one time.

4- Likewise, the game misrepresents the conflict by completely omitting the settler colonial nature of Israel. Abby and her friends are not keeping Seraphites in a racial ghetto in the game, so when Seraphites attack them you assume the Seraphites are just crazy people, which is what the author wants you to think.

5- In the end, the cycle of violence is ""resolved"" by just genociding the Palestinians. This is portrayed as something unfortunate but inevitable. The seraphites are shown so negatively by this point that most players won't really feel anything at all seeing them being genocided. In fact, the game spends the last moments before they are genocided to remind you that Palestinians are so unfathomably evil that the trans Palestinian's mother tried to kill her own child for being trans. Meanwhile in reality, it's not Palestinian mothers that kill Palestinian children, it's the Israeli army.

6- Neil Druckmann said he made this game because he watched 2 Israeli settlers be killed by Palestinians and felt hatred for Palestinians as a result. He said he was ""disgusted"" by his hatred for Palestinians but he also said he made the game so he could show everyone would feel the same hate in that situation. He basically felt he wanted to kill all Palestinians, then was like ""ok maybe not all of them"", and then made a game to persuade you to feel like you too, would want to kill all Palestinian, to make himself feel good about it. Except that most normal people do not want to commit genocide and Neil Druckmann is a psychopathic fuck, so instead it made everyone just feel the game was miserable for no reason.

7- He portrays the IDF as near perfect. Enormous amount of time is spent humanizing the IDF soldiers. Even the criticism of IDF which is that genociding the Palestinians is bad, is not shown to be a moral fault of IDF but rather, the Palestinians brought it on themselves by harassing the IDF too much.

8- Ellie is irrelevant to the story. The story is basically about Abby, the real protagonist. Ellie is basically just a stand-in for the American audience who over the course of the game learns to stop worrying and love the IDF. Joel is killed to simulate Neil Druckmann watching 2 Israeli settlers be killed and wanting revenge. Then every single person Ellie kills is shown to be actually decent people with hopes and dreams (because they are IDF stand-ins) and you feel like it's saying killing people is bad, then half way through you switch to Abbie and the game suddenly shifts to ""Hell Yeah, Kill all them backwards brown people"" style with none of the people Abby kills being shown as having been good people. The gameplay is identical between the two parts, but player is scolded for killing people in the first part and then celebrated for killing people in the 2nd part. Why? Because Ellie is killing IDF stand-ins who are human, and Abby is killing Palestinian stand-ins which is ""unfortunate but necessary"".

9- The story makes no sense if you don't know it's about Israel-Palestine conflict. Why are these two groups fighting over land in Seattle when humanity has gone near extinct, there's plenty of land everywhere, and neither of them have any meaningful connection to Seattle? Because it has nothing to do with Seattle, it's about Palestine. Why are the Seraphites using skyscrapers to ""get around"" WLF as if WLF is a state presence when they are supposedly another post apocalyptic faction with roughly the same strength? Because it's actually about Palestine. The story is completely and utterly nonsensical otherwise.

This game is basically ""Birth of a Nation"" for videogames. It's there to justify ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians by dehumanizing them. Serves no other purpose.

I also believe that Israel has the right to defend itself now that it does exist. 

That being said, many people I've talked to about this subject always say that 'there were better options' or 'The Jews didn't need Palestine, they could have found a better solution' when talking about the initial formation of Israel, which is something I've wondered for a while. But whenever I ask where the Jews should have gone, or if they ever needed to go anywhere, they mostly come up blank. The two genuine solutions I have been given were:

1. Carve out a piece of Germany to serve as a Jewish State. This seems like the most popular alternative _now,_ but whenever I think about this from a mid 20th century perspective I feel that this would be an incredibly problematic option since the Germans, especially those still sympathetic to the Nazis, would see this as proof that the Jews are in control, and I doubt many Jewish people would want to remain in Germany. 
2. Sitka Alaska. Sitka Alaska was offered up, but the Alaskans and the Jews both denied this. I do agree that being sent to some cold backwater (sorry Alaska, no disrespect) would be seen as akin to Hitler's plan to send all the Jews to Madagascar to fend for themselves. It sounds like a way to just get rid of the Jews and send them off somewhere.

mhu7keu,24,"&gt;In a defensive stance, the Battleships would adopt an airspace-denial role, not unlike how they were used in World War II, but with modernized weaponry; the Battleship would be like a floating Iron Dome to intercept and neutralize incoming enemy missiles and aircraft

Why does that need to be done by a Battleship, as opposed to the Frigates and Destroyers that play the role of Fleet Air Defence at the moment?

&gt;allowing the Carriers to get 50-100 miles from the target and pound the enemy with repeated airstrikes.

Most air-launched missiles have longer ranges than that when they leave their host aircraft, to say nothing of the distance the planes travel after take-off and before weapons launch.

&gt;In an offensive stance, the Battleships would rush forward and pound the enemy from close range (ie. up to 15 miles away)

Eating absolute shit from enemy anti-ship missiles while they close the range, if they even can - if the enemy ships are faster than your big heavy battleships, they can just turn and run and fire AShMs backwards in a stern chase until they run out of ocean or you run out of battleships.

&gt;The Battleships would also be able to coordinate with aircraft, calling in airstrikes on enemy land or surface targets, jamming or hacking incoming enemy missiles, disabling enemy air defenses with high-intensity cyberattacks (and thus creating openings for airstrikes), and providing live information for fighters in the air.

**Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has allegedly instructed his three ministers to examine the consequences of leaving the International Criminal Court (ICC), with a particular focus on the implications for the European Union. This decision is likely prompted by the ICC Chief Prosecutor’s request in May for the issuance of an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.**

In response to a query from [24.hu](http://24.hu), the Press Office of the Prime Minister’s Office stated: ‘The International Criminal Court, which addresses crimes against humanity, has recently made several decisions that are not legal but clearly political, thereby undermining the authority of the organization. Hungary rejects the use of international courts as a political tool.’

It is not clear from the response which decisions were being referred to, but it is highly likely they were alluding to ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu. As reported by Hungarian Conservative, on 20 May, Khan mentioned in an exclusive interview with CNN that he had requested the issuance of arrest warrants from the ICC for Netanyahu, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, and two senior Hamas leaders: Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, leader of the Al Qassam Brigades, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, among others.

  
Viktor Orbán subsequently criticized the Chief Prosecutor’s decision in a post on X, describing it as ‘absurd and shameful.’

On the same day the [*24.hu*](http://24.hu) article was published, Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó shared a Facebook post stating that Hungary considers the ICC’s decision against Israel’s prime minister and defence minister to be [nonsensical and politically motivated](https://www.facebook.com/szijjarto.peter.official/posts/1005435517716408).","Hungary Is Allegedly Considering Leaving the International Criminal Court

I know this has been known for years but it shocks me that the U.N. allows the UNRWA to continue. 

It seems to be indisputable fact that the UNRWA leaders funnel tons of money away from Palestinian aid into the hands of Hamas and luxury travel for themselves.

It seems indisputable fact the UNRWA relentlessly force feeds Palestinian children blind hatred of Jews and Israel with disinformation.

It seems indisputable fact the UNRWA staff rejoiced on October 7th, the principal of it even saying “burn baby burn” in a mocking Facebook comment post referring to that poor baby burnt in an oven by Hamas. Not only this but it seems UNRWA are direct Hamas members in some cases, such as the science teacher making rockets for them. 

My question is are people suing the shit out of them and exposing them? And also holding the U.N. accountable by extension? 

So much of the disinformation from this crisis has stemmed from the UNRWA being given legitimacy. I think 99% of its staff are radicalised Hamas militants by Association and yet the U.N. quotes their statistics like it’s factual reliable data from the UN itself.

Hi so I’m from the US and am relatively young (highschool student). I live in a place with many Jews and Muslims and, relatively speaking, there’s a big divide. People aren’t at each others necks, but even students like me share strong feelings, of course. Personally I just don’t want to see people die, and that’s the opinion I feel most people outside of the religions or who have no geographic connections here in the US feel. Personally I have no religious bias- I have some Jewish family and friends but also have Muslim friends. 

Here’s my understanding of the war:
Israel and Palestine exist together, after the British left. After this there’s a gap in my knowledge- some say Israel is really occupying Palestine and vice versa. I think that’s an opinionated question, because I see different people having a different opinion.
Either way, from there, hamas attacks Israel, but why? I understand it can be because the deep rooted religious wars behind it, but if hamas is a terrorist organization bombing innocent Israeli people, how can anyone support that? In a “f*** around and find out” retaliation, Israel tells the Palestinian people to flee Gaza, before bombing them in retaliation. Here’s where things get dicey for me- Gaza Strip is not big at all. The people can’t really leave. But at the same time, what is Israel doing to do, sit there and let hamas and Hazbulla bomb their innocent people? I don’t think so. So Israel fights back, at the same time killing innocent people. 

I don’t understand how anyone could support Hamas. They killed innocent people first, and Israel retaliated. Of course, Israel killed innocent people too, so they are not out of the blame. But at the same time, what other choice would they have? Terrorists won’t sit down for a cup of coffee and talk diplomacy, right? 

I’m not trying to sound like I support Israel here- I don’t. I don’t support killing of ANY innocent people. But I can’t understand the support for Hamas. Please let me know what I’m missing, if anything.",Help me understand more please.,0.89,21,0,2023-11-10 17:35:23

The majority of Zionists- and even I believe the majority of Israeli Zionists, are anti-settler (and definitely anti violent-settler). But they don't have much power to stop them- they don't even live in the same place as them unless they are themselves settlers. Unless you want Israelis to move to (settle) the West Bank to physically stand against the settlers? That seems counterproductive though.

They are so bad that even Zionists who are otherwise insistent on Israel's sainthood won't defend them. But to denounce them is not enough. 

The settlers are Israel's dark shadow. They disprove every claim Israel makes about what kind of country it is. They do not want peace, they are extremely racist and Jewish supremacist, they laugh in the face of international law, they attack the innocent (no self defense), etc etc. Now, every country has untamed militants. You can't for example hold all of America responsible for the KKK, or all of Nigeria responsible for Boko Haram. 

HOWEVER. Those countries do not fund those groups. America simply ignores the Klan, and Nigeria actively opposes and fights BH. Israel does nothing of the sort. They are actually in support of the settlers through their actions. Everyone is so focused on Hamas when there is a state-sponsored terrorist enclave with members in the Israeli government. These are people so insane that they're eyeing more land in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt once they're done with the Palestinians. And I cannot stress this enough, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FUNDING AND PROTECTING THEM FOR DECADES. 

I'm honestly tired of conversations about this conflict leaving them out. It's like a massive elephant in the room that nobody wants to deal with. Even the ICJ case didn't bother addressing them.

I’ve passed through the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. No one knows I’m Jewish, but I got the impression from some tour guides that being Jewish itself is not really an issue (so long as everyone is respectful towards Islam in these countries of course).

People have been very warm, and I can see that Islam is a religion of good solid moral principles. Crime is relatively low in these countries, although the governments are feudal monarchies, so there isn’t a lot of classical liberty as Westerners are used to.

Judaism too is a religion of solid moral principles. Islam has Sharia and Judaism has Mitzvot + Halakah, both similar ideas. Likewise both religions have adapted to modern life recently within the last century. From what little I read of the Quran, it reads a bit like poetry. At times the Torah does too.

It’s a shame that in the West, Jewish and Muslim groups have outright dislike of each other when the two religions share a common warmth.

This war is unfortunate but largely no one in the West can do much. We could donate to the side we most agree with, but that’s it. Screaming at each other for something beyond our control and generating hate just seems to be about as productive as trying to stop the flow of a stream using your bare hands.

What if Jews and Muslims in the West simply agreed to disagree on the conflict even with strong feelings on the matter, and otherwise be friendly, do local charity together, not hate individuals in our host countries for a political conflict far away.

The current crisis in the Middle East is tragic &amp; pulls at the heart strings of our very humanity.  In the ‘West,’ decades of identity politics, dumbing down the public, and a generation of people who are willfully ignorant have all contributed to a general public detached from reality, affixed to their phones, and all-too-ready to express outrage over anything &amp; everything.  

Against that backdrop, we have an Iranian-funded proxy militia who invaded another sovereign country &amp; started a war. For clarity, it’s worth noting that Iran’s goal is, “death to Israel,” and “death to America.” 
**Genocide** - *the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group* (src: Oxford Dictionary). 

“Death to Israel,” “From the River to the Sea,” - these are rallying cries for *genocide*.  They’ve  repeatedly demonized the Jews. Example are too numerous to list, here are a few:
1. President Ahmadinejad’s threats to “wipe Israel off the map,” prompted letters to the UN Security Council, US Sec of State &amp; Int’l Criminal Court, re:  violation of Convention on **Genocide**.
2. Supreme Leader Khamenei - at “Jerusalem Day” gathering 2012, called for unity “to remove the Zionist black stain from human society.” - **Genocide**
3. Prior to that, Khamenei took inspiration from Hitler, stating there is “justification to kill all the Jews and annihilate Israel, and Iran must take the helm."" - Direct quote, inciting **Genocide**
4. Mid-2010’s, senior Iranian officials classified Jews as nonhuman/ subhuman: ""bloodthirsty barbarians,"" ""filthy bacteria,"" ""wild beasts,"" ""cattle,"" ""cancer,"" ""filthiest criminals,"" ""a blot,"" ""a stain,"" ""wild dogs"" - Direct quotes - **racist**, **xenophobic**, **dehumanizing**
5. Pezeshkian, 2024, inaugurated with chants of “Death to Israel” &amp; “Death to America” (src: Reuters) - **Genocide**

With a well established agenda of destroying Israel, destroying America, and eradicating the Jews - **Genocide** - Iran is too weak &amp; disliked by their own regional neighbors to take direct action, they can’t survive the reprisal. So they fund regional militia groups that allow them to pursue their goals of **Genocide**, in particular:
1. Hamas (Palestine)
2. Islamic Jihad (Palestine)
3. Hezbollah (Lebanon)
4. Houthis (Yemen)
5. Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (Iraq)
6. Kata'ib Hezbollah (Iraq)
7. Harakat al-Nujaba (Syria/ Iraq)

Iran has their Al-Quds branch coordinating the militias and reporting/taking direct orders from Khamenei. All of this is a campaign to carry out their goal of **Genocide**, while insulating Iranian territory from the conventional cost of blood at the expense of other countries’ citizens, to whom they claim to be allies.  One terrorist state running multiple foreign terrorist regimes. 

Palestinians have demonstrated solidarity with Hamas, allowing Hamas to effectively rule them &amp; do whatever they decide to. In March, support for Hamas among Palestinians had *grown*. In June, Palestinian support for Hamas had increased even further. (Src: Ramallah-based non-profit Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research). 

According to the Palestinian polls in June, “*only seven percent of Gazans blamed Hamas for their suffering. Seventy-one percent of all Palestinians supported Hamas’s decision to attack Israel on October 7 — up 14 points among Gazans and down 11 points among West Bank Palestinians compared to three months ago. Fifty-nine percent of all Palestinians thought Hamas should rule Gaza, and 70 percent were satisfied with the role Hamas has played during the war.*”

That’s reality. Millions of displaced people who were in support of Hamas, a terrorist organization funded by **Genocidal** Iran, coordinated by terrorists in IRGC &amp; run by Al-Quds specialists under the direct blessing of Khamenei, have galvanized every day since the Oct 7, 2023 massacre inside Israel.  Hamas has approx. 40,000 fighters. Palestine has a population of over 5.5 million (src: World Population Review; and, U.N.).  Gaza has a population of approx. 2.23 million, the West Bank has approx. 3.2 million. 

If 5.5 Million people are content to be ruled by 40,000 terrorists, celebrate their acts of violence, yet deny any personal responsibility, align themselves with the world’s epicenter of hate, in service of their **Genocidal** agenda, and that terrorist regime starts a war by invading a sovereign country, killing thousands, raping men, women &amp; children __*on video*__, what right does that group have to claim anyone aside from themselves is attempting **Genocide**?  And how is it that anyone, much less homosexual white people from America &amp; Western Countries, can call any targeted form of conventional retaliation, ‘*Genocide*’ with a straight face? 

I’m sorry but did starting a war become *inconvenient*?  Not inconvenient enough to do anything about their leadership, regime, allies, plan forward. Just enough to pretend a few thousand deaths, while horrible, are somehow **Genocide** the likes of which exceed the *proven* Holocaust that they so ardently deny? 

Relative to their population, Israel endured 20x 9/11’s simultaneously - if the 9/11 victims had all been raped &amp; tortured on video before being marched into the Twin Towers for execution.  So my questions for anyone who’s studied world history is at what point does a people need to be accountable for the way in which they’ve decided to live? At what point are a people who have, even after an atrocity, expressed support for their leaders part of the terror machine?  At what point is a civil war better than a world war?  How does it fall upon the countries who are being targeted &amp; victimized by Iran, Hamas &amp; their so-called “Axis of Resistance” to supply humanitarian aid, prolonging the suffering &amp; dragging out the eventual outcome?  Why is there a moral equivocation between terrorists invading another country, raping &amp; killing for sport, destroying all they can, then crying about the *consequences*?  Gays got rights in America within the last 20 years… maybe some of the LGTBQ-aggrieved should go to Gaza and protest in solidarity, see how well that works out? 

If a Nazi didn’t personally run a gas chamber, but loaded the Gypsys, Jews, Handicapped &amp; Homosexuals onto the trains, are they exculpated from their role in the ensuing torture &amp; death machines?  Should the allies have celebrated the virtuous Nazi’s who did everything but open the Zyklon B or operate an oven? 

Palestinians invaded another country, raped, murdered en mass, and memorialized the moment on film.  Palestinians continue to support the regime that did this. Palestinians continue to provide the perpetrators safe harbor. Palestinians, and Iranians, *planned* on exploiting Western liberals - the same people that they’d kill in an instant, if given the chance.  The strategy behind this attack *was the ensuing international dissent* that has emerged in the aftermath. 

The vast majority of the human race believes it’s unacceptable to do what Hamas did, but politically the first concern is patronizing the vocal minority who have no skin in the game or who have direct connections to the perpetrators, all of which have now recast themselves as the ‘victims’ - of their own actions. 

Most of all, can someone explain how *conventional* retaliation from a terrorized country toward their invaders qualifies as *Genocide*?   Call it war. Call it a humanitarian crises.  I’ve not heard one voice call for the extinction of the Muslim peoples calling for the extinction of the Jews.  Liberals won’t like this, but sometimes you reap what you sow in this life.  I don’t say this in a heartless manner, or in giving Israel a “free-pass.”  However, America lecturing anyone on how to respond to anything militarily is, in itself, a sad satirical irony.  If I’m middle class, but I identify as a billionaire, should AmEx issue me a Black Card?  It’s clear as day we’re headed for a catastrophe, because people who have lived through or witnessed a ‘genocide,’ they don’t use the word so lightly.  Now that we’re out of WW2 survivors, seems history is destined to repeat itself.  

So please, explain to me how terrorists in Iran openly promulgating **Genocide** against the Jews &amp; Americans for decades have somehow orchestrated the ‘actual’ **Genocide** of their own militants at the hands of their preferred victims? 
While you’re at it, please explain why Western tax dollars are flying out the treasury doors to provide food/water/medicine for the displaced, and in turn the displaced are using the charity not to chart a different course but instead to *increase* their support for Hamas, spending borrowed time like it’s counterfeit at the expense of our economic &amp; civil unrest.  

Parting thought: If those who start wars are permitted to endure war, doesn’t that establish the boundaries of acceptable behavior in a global order?  Should we keep treating the most sinister offenders to a reprieve on the consequences until things literally go nuclear?  Why haven’t i heard anyone exhorting Palestinians to get Palestine, their home, under control?  This entire conflict was engineered to be nothing more than a horrifying outburst giving way to the manipulation of common sense which would divide &amp; castrate the international community.

What they do not realise is that the opposite is true. Not only is defeat possible, but in Gaza, they are winning.

For one, countless anaylsts, including those in Israel have commented that Israel has already lost the war. And that it cannot beat Hamas or the Palestinian Joint-Operations Room.

[As early as last month,](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/israel-losing-netanyahu-wont-back-down-his-war-aims) the British defence think tank reported that:

&gt; Israel is not achieving its war aims against Hamas. First, it has only obtained a handful of the hostages. Some have been killed; the fates of many others are still unknown.

Second, Hamas has not been destroyed. Destruction of a terrorist organisation is difficult to measure. Some point to leadership decapitation. However, as Jenna Jordan has pointed out, attriting terrorist leaders seldom brings about their organisations’ collapse. Factors such as popular support, ideology and organisational structure play bigger roles in deciding these groups’ fates. Another measure used to determine if a terrorist group has been destroyed is if its territorial sphere has been reduced or removed. Israel has failed to deprive Hamas of the territory it governed prior to the war. Hamas has been battered in Gaza, but it is still a political force to be reckoned with. Unaffiliated Palestinian clans have refused to join in a post-war reconstruction effort for fear of retaliation by Hamas. Third, Israel has not been able to secure its borders. While it has regained control over some border crossings, the underground infrastructure that has allowed Hamas to engage in smuggling weapons and carrying out attacks is still in place.

[Analdou Agency reported that a former Mossad chief had stated that Israel was unequovically losing the war in Gaza.](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-on-losing-end-in-gaza-war-former-mossad-deputy-chief/3223179). Even Zionist publishers like [JP reported this](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-803955).

[As CNN has reported, Hamas has remained wholly combat effective.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/). This is a pattern that staretd early in the war. By December, the IDF was declaring most Hamas batallions to have been dismantled.

This was quickly revealed to be a propaganda lie. As in early 2024, reports emerged that Hamas had begun rehabilitating its batallions in North Gaza. Reports from the Neo-Conservative think tank isw argued that as much as 80% of Hamas' fighting strength was restored. 

According to the isw's report on MArch 27th, they argue that this means Palestinian fighters ""retain  significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City."" and that ""The return of Israeli forces to [Zaytoun] suggests that Palestinian militias continue to operate there similar to how these militias still have a presence in other portions of the northern Gaza Strip.""

We can also check pretty much every battle in Gaza to see how this is true.

The first battle in Gaza was the battle of Beit Hanoun. Despite IDF claims, they never occupied the city. And the battle is considered as having ended in a Palestinian victory. The isw reported that when the IDF left in December, the P-JOR continued effective control over Beit Hanoun. Beit Hanoun was used as a base to attack the IDF and send rockets into Israel, demonstrating that teh IDF had failed to defeat the JOR in Beit Hanoun.

Then we have the First Battle of Jabalia. As the isw reported, Hamas retained control of Jabalia after Israel withdrew in May. 

&gt; ""These points taken together reflect the degree to which Hamas and other Palestinian militias remain combat effective in and around Jabalia. Hamas and the other militias will almost certainly resume their efforts to reconstitute there as the IDF units have left.""

Then we have the Battle of Shuja'iyya. Though the IDF declared victory here, heavy casualties forced them to withdraw and as al-Jazeera reported, Palestinians retained control of the city. Further evidence of Palestinain control is that several months later, the IDF returned to the region to try and wrestle control away from the JOR.

This 2nd battle was just as disastrous for the IDF. After retreating in July, Hamas and the PIJ retained dominance in the city. Again, al-Jazeera reported how this had occured. But not stopping there, when the IDF withdrew in videos from the area one could see Palestinian militants with guns in their hands standing around in broad daylight. Alongside this, government officials working for the P-JOR immediately remerged in the city, as if they had never left, and reasserted doubly Palestinian control in the region.

Then we have the siege of Khan Yunis. The first Israeli assualt ended in abject failure. so great was the routing of the IDF they withdrew from all of southern Gaza. Khan Yunis itself remained under the control of the Joint Operations Room. Again, as reported by the isw. The 2nd and 3rd battles ended in much the same way and in far shorter timespans.

Then comes al-Qarara. By all acounts, a Palestinian victory.The isw reported that Israel was defeated in al-Qarara. They had failed to achieve any of their aims. P-JOR remained in control. No high ranking militants were found or killed, and accordinng to anaylsts, Hamas remained combat effective in the region.

This is how every battle that has ended thus far has gone. Israel went in, killed civilians for a few weeks. Ran into resistance, tried to fight back, upon seeing heavy casualties retreated with Palestine still in control.

This is not what victory looks like. Israel is, by all measures losing.","The evidence that Hamas is in fact, beating the IDF in Gaza",0.18,0,0,2024-11-30 16:33:37

It doesn't stop to amaze how people take something as positive and innocent as trying to protect different communities and lying to make it something it isn't.",IsraelPalestine,2025-03-01 12:15:45,1j0xma0,Sleeve_hamster,0,8,0,True,2019-03-26 21:22:54,13.0,0.0,24.0,4439.0,4476.0,0,"Have you ever heard of Article 173 of the Israeli Penal Code? It’s a law that often goes under the radar in discussions about Israeli law and its impact on free speech, but it has serious implications for freedom of expression within the country. In essence, Article 173 criminalizes anti-religious sentiment, with punishment potentially including up to a year in prison for anyone found guilty of offending religious beliefs. On the surface, this may sound like an innocuous measure aimed at maintaining public order, but a deeper look reveals its implications in the context of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and its broader legal system.

Here's what it legally says anyways (thanks to u/JeffB1517)

injury to religious sentiment 173.*
*If a person does any of the following, then he is liable to one year
imprisonment:*

*(1) he publishes a publication that is liable crudely to offend the
religious faith or sentiment of others;*

*(2) he voices in a public place and in the hearing of another person
any word or sound that is liable crudely to offend the religious faith
or sentiment of others.* (Source: https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Israel-Penal-Law-5737-1977-eng.pdf)

So, what exactly does this law entail, and what does it mean for anyone who criticizes the Israeli state or its treatment of Palestinians? In simpler terms, Article 173 is akin to a blasphemy law—a law that penalizes any actions, speech, or statements that could be considered disrespectful or offensive to religious groups. The wording of the law, however, is vague enough that it could be used as a tool for silencing political dissent, especially when criticism of Israel’s policies is framed as being anti-religious.

But here's the critical question: What does blasphemy mean in the context of this law, and who gets to decide which beliefs are protected? Is it just about religion, or does the law also get weaponized to silence criticisms of Israeli government policies, especially concerning Palestinians? This is where things get murky. If someone criticizes Israeli state actions, or questions its treatment of Palestinian people in areas like Gaza or the West Bank, could they be accused of anti-Semitic sentiments or anti-religious actions, even if their criticism is purely political and human rights-focused? The potential for this law to be misused to stifle free speech and limit legitimate political discourse is a valid concern.

It’s important to note that, like many legal systems around the world, Israel’s government is often accused of using legal frameworks like Article 173 not just to protect religious sensitivities but as a way to protect its own political power. This is what makes the situation concerning—it blurs the line between religious protection and political repression. In other words, the law doesn’t just shield religious beliefs; it might also be used to censor criticism of Israeli policies, especially those that affect Palestinians, whose voices are frequently marginalized in this debate.

Furthermore, this law aligns Israel’s legal practices closer to nations that have blasphemy laws, such as Pakistan or India. While countries like Pakistan and India often use blasphemy laws to silence religious minorities or suppress critical voices, Israel’s use of such legal tools to silence dissent, especially political dissent related to the Palestinian cause, positions it in a troubling parallel with these countries. The question then arises: Is a democratic country supposed to have such a law in place? Democracy is supposed to thrive on open dialogue, robust debate, and the free exchange of ideas, even (or especially) when those ideas are critical of the state. However, laws like Article 173 seem to be at odds with this principle, as they criminalize dissent under the guise of protecting religion.

In comparison, countries like the United States, which hold freedom of speech as a constitutional right, have laws that protect speech as long as it doesn't incite violence or hatred. While even the U.S. has its challenges with free speech—such as hate speech laws or the silencing of certain opinions—it still holds the principle of free speech in a much higher regard than a law like Article 173 does. This stark difference suggests that Israel’s legal framework, by implementing such a law, positions itself further away from the ideal of democratic free speech, aligning more with authoritarian practices and less with the principles many associate with liberal democracies.

The reality is, Article 173 and its potential to criminalize legitimate criticisms of Israeli state policies are part of a broader legal and political environment that stifles Palestinian voices. When Palestinians or their allies speak out against the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, or within Israel itself, they face the very real threat of being labeled as anti-Semitic or anti-religious. With the use of laws like Article 173, even non-violent political dissent can be met with accusations of blasphemy or religious disrespect, thus limiting the ability of individuals or groups to advocate for human rights without fear of legal retribution.

So, when we look at this law and its implications, we have to ask: Is this the behavior of a democracy? Can a country that criminalizes speech under the guise of protecting religion truly call itself democratic? Or is Israel, in this instance, just another state using the law to maintain control over political narratives, suppress criticism, and demonize dissenters? The conversation about Article 173 is a reminder that democracy and free speech are not absolute but can be vulnerable to manipulation when legal systems are used to silence the voices of the oppressed.

So since you read the title above, I want to get straight to the point, my Dad is Jewish, his family are descendants from Russian Jews which migrated to the west after the Russian Revolution of 1917, my mom in the other hand, is a Dominican (Dominican Republic) She is a Christian and wildly supports Israel. 

I am just gonna say this out of my own heart and opinion, I love Israel, with all my heart, I would die for them, for the freedoms and liberties of the Israeli people (not the government, it's a disgrace, well kinda. Anyway, I have heard some people state that Israel was built from racism, even though I love Israel, I do believe that this is, well.. kinda true, even though Palestine never existed before Israel's founding, and the Palestinian people weren't really, well, called or referred to that particular nam, it has come to my conclusion that Israel had the right of way, but I do not support the fact that Israel occupied/took over the lives of these Arabs and made them miserable.

I have heard of Nakba, which pretty sure was the marching of thousands of Arabs being expelled from the newly formed Jewish state, which, in my oppinion is racist and it is just wrong in general. It's like letting random strangers come into your house because you're kind but then you get kicked out because they feel like they need a home but you don't. I don't know it is just my opinion correct me if I am wrong.

Another thing I want to point out is the genocide part, I think, in general, Pro-Palestinian supporters over exaggerate genocide, the definition of genocide is intentionally killing or wiping out a specific group, race, or population from an area. Israel is not intentionally killing Palestinians, in fact, they are trying their best to avoid it, I mean, in my opinion, how hard would it be if your enemies were hidden among the local population, and their bases of operations were on the most populous areas, it will be practically impossible for them to take a hit, which is something Israel has been trying to do, but has been miserably failing.

Next, I want to point out that Israel is a first world country, compared to most Arab nations surrounding it, Gaza doesn't even have a legitimate government, plus, even if you call Hamas a government, your just naive. I am going to say some things, I see that Israeli soldiers have been doing ""inappropriate"" things to Arab woman, which is of course, in the human level, just terrifyingly horrible and inhumane. But in the other hand, you have to look at the bigger picture, whatever those soldiers are doing to those Arab women, Hamas is doing it 10 times worse to the Israeli ones. Which is extremely horrifying and horrific to go through and must be stopped, both of them, Israeli and Hamas soldiers, immideatly. 

Furthermore, I just don't see the point in supporting one side, I mean, I understand, but in another way, I don't. Israel has the right to exist, just as the Arab people have the right to self-determination and freedom. Both people have done really bad things in the past, but it doesn't mean that they have to be mean and horrific to each other. It's just not sufficient and ideal for both peoples to keep fighting each other. I don't see the point anymore, they have been doing this for 75 years straight, and they are just not stopping.

(I am so sorry that I am typing so much, I just have so much that I want share and words just make it hard to state it, just one more thing.)

Last thing, my parents are pro-Israel supporters and there is no changing their minds evevn if you try. I feel like supporting Israel and its people.

What are your thoughts on Don &amp; Joe’s responses to the war?

My brief opinion:

I’m having a hard time processing Trump’s complete avoidance of the topic. Especially when he was asked if he supported the creation of a Palestinian state. He completely dismissed it like it didn’t even matter to him at all and used the time to answer something else. He either 1. Really doesn’t care or 2. Has no balls. Might be option 3 all of the above.

Whether or not you like Joe or Joe’s answer, at least he gave an answer! Tired of the deflecting. Joe came out strong for Israel IMO and explained his path towards an end to war in simple terms.

Also —- Don said Joe was “like a Palestinian, but a bad one” — I mean like, what? Completely nonsensical. 

Maybe some could deduce that ^ means Trump is for Israel, but I didn’t really see any blatantly outward or strong support there either.

His main thing was “If I were president we wouldn’t have had a war in the first place.” Ah yes, Trump the great peacemaker! Lol. 

He offered no solutions, no view or plan for the future. No vision. I do however believe in his ability to negotiate with war criminals because he already speaks the language of a criminal with too much damn power. But would he negotiate for America’s benefit or for his own? 😬🤷🏻‍♀️

He might’ve thought it was a good political move to dodge but…again it looked weak AF to me!

This is a funny thing to say, considering that prior to October 7, 2023, many years of Netanyahu and Likud in power were the most peaceful in the history of Israel.

Your understanding of Netanyahu's role and IDF actions in Gaza is somewhere between conspiracy and fantasy.

I’m not sure if this subreddit is the best place to communicate them but I wanted to say my piece. 

Both Hamas and Israel suck. The left and right pick sides like a sport team, leaving the lives of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians at risk. 

I’ll start with Israel first as they actually have a functioning government and significantly more and better resources. The blame for this attack; in its entirety, falls on bibi’s shoulders. He knew this attack was being planned, he gave aid to Hamas knowing something was coming. Bibi built his entire career off of the Palestinian struggle. As long as the Gazans were violent Bibi and his party would stay in power. Bibi is violence. He has to keep the cycle of violence continuing to stay in power. He killed Rabim and he’ll kill all of Israel to stay in power. While Hamas hides in tunnel, the IDF murders civilians, and delays the destruction of the tunnel network. Bibi set an arbitrary goal as the end of the campaign. Yet in his quest to decimate Hamas he secures a new base for them for generations to come. No one has been better at Hamas recruitment than Benjamin Netanyahu. The war will never end as long as Bibi and the Likud remain in power.

Now Hamas. Gaza hasn’t seen an election since 2006. Look at their population pyramid the majority of Gazans weren’t alive for the last election. Hamas doesn’t share the interest of their people. That’s why they can’t have free elections. Since hamas can’t compete with Israel straight up, they use their own people as shields while they lay in their tunnels unharmed. The attack on Oct 7th was disgusting. But the logic behind it is truly demonic. Hamas leads their entire population to slaughter, knowing after the Oct 7 attack what the Israeli response would be. Hamas strategy is clear and simple. They let their people get slaughtered, knowing that their citizens would put all of it online. Effectively deputizing every victim. This isn’t a war of blood and metal but of heart and mind. Same strategy as Vietnam and MLK, instigate violence upon yourself, then use the unreasonable blood shed to make it impossible for your enemy to justify their fight. The fact that we fell for this again is the biggest justification for history classes. 

We should feel sympathy for the civilians of Gaza, but not of Hamas. We should support our Israeli allies, not the Likud. Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism and we should oppose both antisemitism and Islamophobia where they stand. The only way forward is for Israel to reject the Likud, for free and fair elections in Gaza, the end of Israeli colonialism, and a unified Arabian front backed by the UN to ensure peace within Gaza’s borders while they rebuild and change their political system. Personally I will always oppose theocracies. The most religious states tend to be the most violent, but there is potential for peace in the Middle East. Should the Likud leave office, a new party can reignite Israeli diplomatic ties. And a Jewish-Sunni alliance can strengthen American foreign policy and effectively isolate the more violent Shia regimes. The Middle East could be an economic, academic, and tourist powerhouse if they’d at least act unified.

“The Legal Right of The Jewish People To The Land of Israel”

https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/what-is-the-legal-right-of-the-jewish-people-to-the-land-of-israel/


Because of the requirement of 1.5k characters - this is some of the article 


Many advocates and Israelis mistakenly claim that our legal right to this land comes from the 1947 Partition Plan. But this is incorrect. The 1947 Partition Plan came through the UN General Assembly, whose resolutions are non-binding and can only make recommendations.

Consider this from another perspective: if the legal right of the Jewish people to this land came from the Partition Plan, it would mean that the Palestinians have a legal right not only to the West Bank and Gaza but also to parts of modern Israel. 

This is because Israel expanded its territories in the War of Independence after the Palestinians rejected the Partition Plan and started a war.

So, where does the legal right to this land come from?

The legal right comes from the Balfour Declaration, the San Remo Conference, the Mandate for Palestine, and the UN Charter. It’s ok, let me explain.


Balfour Declaration
The Balfour Declaration “promised” the Jewish people the establishment of a national home in Palestine, and the Mandate for Palestine, confirmed by the League of Nations, endorsed this promise.
What does “national home” mean?
National home in Palestine = Jewish state. How do I know? By listening to the British and Americans.
In 1921, a year before the Mandate for Palestine, Balfour and George Lloyd, then the British Prime Minister, told Chaim Weizmann (then President of the Zionist Organization) that the Balfour Declaration always intended a Jewish state eventually.

This understanding was shared by the Americans in 1919 also.

The colonizers or imperialist power in Palestine and many other places in the middle east were the British empire. The early zionist movement did use powerful jewish figures like some members of the Rotchild family to influence the British empire, but thats where their power ended.

The reason the British empire mostly favored the jews and the unfair 50/50 split despite the 63% majority arab population was because the arabs living in Palestine were seen as collaborators of the ottoman empire at WW1 which were of course enemies to the British empire and because the jews convinced the British of more “aliot”, basically saying that more jews would come to Israel in the near future, which was true and did happen.

The whole narrative of white privileged Europeans jews stealing Palestine also falls apart when you looks at the Mizrahi jews living in Israel which compose about 50% of the Israeli population, Mizrahi jews are jews from the middle-east, from countries such as Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, etc. Similarly to the Ashkenazi jews, Mizrahi jews were also mistreated in their countries and left for the jewish homeland dream.

I have seen mentions of Uganda being brought up by Pro Palestinian spokesmen as if it was a valid alternative to Israel to try and alienate the jews from Israel. Israel was also the dream homeland for all jews, for generation jews have dreamt of rebuilding old Jerusalem, a popular Jewish prayer at the time before Israel was “Next year in holy Jerusalem”.

Another point being constantly brought up is Israel being an Apartheid state, when it is being brought up people conveniently fail to mention that 21% of Israeli is Arab. These arabs enjoy equal rights, their own political parties and prosperity. Gaza and the weather bank are not part of Israel and have their own governing authorities.

Palestine was a name given to a land that also composed modern Jordan. This land had at 1900 around 600,00 people, 10% were jewish at the time.

My grandfather was taken out of his house in Poland sometime around 1938, his mother father sister and brother were shot at the spot and he was dimmed fit to go to a concentration camp to work, he later came to Israel with no money or family. Now I am not telling this story to yell Holocaust, I am telling this because according to the Palestinian logic there are now lands in Poland where Polish people live that were illegally and very violently taken from my grandfathers family not much longer than 75 years ago. So according to the Palestinian logic, I should be fighting my whole life to get these lands back. But, I don’t feel entitled to these lands in Poland, because although it was unfair or even terrible, the past cannot be corrected. What can be corrected is the present, by trying to come up with a solution that works for both sides, because neither side is going away any time soon.",Palestine the country that was stolen by colonizing Jews,0.67,102,0,2024-01-25 11:39:07

We also now know that Hannibal Directive was initiated that day (as per israeli sources) where a lot of the civillian death that day was caused by Israeli vehicles.

For the most part, the Hamas fighters were targeting IDF soldiers. They were able to kill about 500 of them. . As per sources, they started the attack by storming 12 different IDF bases, successfully incapacitating everyone inside. this is no doubt commendable and heroic. Its resistance. Its 100% justifiable. I don't see why it should be treated any differently to the Hatians revolting against the French, or George Washington and the Patriots killing British troops.

However it is true that some of the Hamas fighers did in fact kill some of the civillians intentionally. I have no problem in condeming it, it was wrong, and they will have to answer to God for what they did.

However if you look across history, every revolution, resistance, or fight against tyranny have war crimes and atrocious acts linked with them. That is just the reality of what resistance is. People just get so radicalized by the oppressing force they end up doing acts that are barbaric. But it would be absurd to suggest said oppressing force is a ""victim"".

Look no further than Nat Turners Rebellion in 1831. Long story short, Nat Turner, along with many other black slaves were able to revolt, murder their owners, and ended up going house to house freeing slaves, along with killing the white families of the households (including children).

The South's response was a carbon copy to what Israel did. Troops were sent and suppressed the rebellions and in the process killed hundreds of innocent black people who weren't even involved. The South subsequently enacted a slew of oppreseive policies on black people that further made their lives hell.

Just like Israel, the South went crazy with the propoganda making up a bunch of things that never happened. The narrative going around there was that the blacks had ""genocidal intent' and wanted to kill all white people.

It is important to recognize that both the Hamas fighers and black slaves who killed civillians were in the wrong and their actions were not by any means justifible. But it would be absurd to suggest this means the White slave owners or the Zionists are somehow ""victims"". No, they are both oppressive, racist regimes that caused the radicalization of these resistance fighters.

We can condemn indivdual crimes against humanity done during these rebellions while also acknowledging the wider picture that neither of these happened in a vacuum.

Zionists always wanted to deny israeli oppresion of gaza with ""we left in 2005"" rhetoric. Nope, they controlled the border, including their coastline, not letting anyone leave. Regulating everthing that went in and out. Poverty and unemployment rate was well over 50% in gaza. and all this ""there was a ceasefire on 10/6"" is just a load of nonsense. They were attacking Gaza just [**a few weeks**](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/24/1201381201/an-israeli-military-raid-has-killed-two-palestinians-in-the-west-bank) and [**a few days**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/04/gaza-strip-protesters-received-bullet-wounds-to-ankles-medics-report) **before 10/7**. These are just two examples, but Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria get attacked by israel a lot more than you realize.

The sad truth is both the white slave owners and the zionist took advantage of their respective uprisings, made up a slew of fabrications and used them to justify oppression over millions of innocents who didn't even partake in their respective rebellions. No it wasn't because the white slave owners or the zionists were ""defending themselves"" like how they portray it, it was really just in the name of maintaining dominance and control. I am honestly  scared as to how these ""Greater Israel"" plans end up playing out.

Muslims came throughout many periods to settle in Israel. Jews left then came back also throughout many periods. Christianity literally started in Israel. The population of the land has been mixing and changing for thousands of years. Some have never left. Some families only arrived in the last century, Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike. Intermarriage, conversion, expulsión , returns. 

There's no point in telling Jews to go back to where they came from, they will tell you they came from here. Jews tried to live abroad, they were murdered for it all over the world (yes including the Arab world which everyone seems to forget). Some jews tried to forget Israel and Judaism, but the nations of the world refused to let that happen. So we came back. Jews sing for a return to Jerusalem in prayers and even at weddings, before the cup is crushed. Al-Aqtsa is one of Islam's holy sites? Israel is our -only- holy land. Al-Aqsta sits on our -most- holy site, the temple grounds, where we believe God is closest, and we are pathetically left to pray to a silly wall. If you don't think Jews should live in Israel, then the only conclusion left is that Jews shouldn't exist, period. This is the most important thing in the religion.

The detractors of Israel claim that Israel supporters will cry ""Antisemitic!"" in response to any claim of IDF war crimes.  

I complained right along with other Israel detractors until I remembered what has always happened when I have brought up the United States' war crimes.  I was born in the United States and live in South Carolina., which is a state populated by flag waving. war mongering Christians.  (fyi--I am also Christian--that is, not Jewish. See footnote at the end if you want to read more about this).

How did Americans in South Carolina react when I said George W. Bush was committing treason by having this country go to war with Iraq?

I was called un-American.  I was the traitor.

How did they react when I spoke of American war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan?

I was denounced as un-American, as a traitor.

How did they react when I denounced the United States for the crimes at Abu Ghraib?

I was the criminal.  Lyndie England and Sgt. Grainer were American heroes.

This reaction is not limited to South Carolina.  After Joe Darby blew the whistle, what was the reaction in Maryland?  Here is a quote a Wikipedia article on Joe Darby:

*The disclosure was not received well by the community in which Darby and his wife, Bernadette, were living in Maryland. They have been shunned by friends and neighbors, their property has been vandalized, and they now reside in protective military custody at an undisclosed location. Bernadette said, ""We did not receive the response I thought we would. People were, they were mean, saying he was a walking dead man, he was walking around with a bull's-eye on his head. It was scary.""*

I am glad I checked with Wiki, because I thought that Joe Darby and his wife had to go into the Federal Witness Protection Program.  Maybe they did, but Wiki says nothing about that.

They Israel supporters who scream ""Antisemitic!"" at the drop of a hat are unique only in the exact wording of their response.  Americans have the exact same reaction.  

Let's face it:  Americans have nothing against war crimes.

America has nothing against the specific war crime of using chemical weapons.  When George W. Bush reported to the American people that Saddam had used chemicals against his own people, George Bush knew what he said was the truth because he was aware that the United States had given Saddam chemical weapons for the purpose of using them against his own people.  But they were his own people only technically.  He used the weapons against the Kurds who were fighting on the side of the Iraqis.

The whole truth was that we gave Saddam the chemicals and he used them against people within Iraq who were fighting with the enemy.

I would have thought that Americans would feel indignant when I proved to them that Saddam's only chemical weapons came from the United States.   But none of the Americans were the least bit indignant when I showed them the proof that we gave Saddam the only chemical weapons we know of him ever having.  I believe they were just glad that Bush came up with some kind of a reason at that time.  

The United States was quick to support Putin being charged by the ICC.

But we energetically object to the charges against Netanyahu, even though it seems clear enough that Putin's crimes don't compare with Netanyahu's.

And Israel's war crimes don't compare with the war crimes of the United States.  Every single American president since Herbert Hoover committed war crimes, and I think every single American president has gone beyond Netananyahu.  Noam Chomsky has documented American war crimes and you can find videos of him explaining them on youtube.

We can say that the United States did not commit war crimes at every opportunity.  We did make some attempt at least at times to avoid committing war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I don't know if Israel ever attempts to avoid committing war crimes.  From the videos that IDF soldiers have posted, I believe some of them look for opportunities and take advantage of every opportunity.

We can respond to accusations of antisemitism by pointing out that anti-semitic sentiments are not required when objecting to babies having their heads blown off.  We have a good response to the claim that we are antisemitic. 

But what could we say if the Israelis pointed out that Israel's war crimes don't hold a candle to the war crimes of the United States?  What could we say if they pointed out that we need to take the beam out of our own eye before we go to remove the mote in theirs.  I wouldn't know what I could say.  They would shut me up with that one.  I am speaking for myself only.  I believe that we must have responses that are beyond adequate but I don't know what they might be today.  Maybe some persons who object to Israel's crimes--as I do--could explain that to  me.  I know I could say, ""Look, just because we have committed war crimes that have resulted in the deaths of millions--that does not justify Israel's crimes.""

The war crimes of the United States probably go beyond the war crimes of any country in history.  We haven't committed genocide that I know of, but our violations of international law have resulted in way more deaths than all the genocides that have been committed or attempted.  

And that claim minimizes the Holocaust in making it look like less than it would be if no such claim were made.  And I would have just violated an  earlier draft of the IHRA's definition of anti-semitism.  I wrote the IHRA about that item--minimizing the Holocaust--and told them I believed that if someone were to state the plain fact that the Nazis killed 9,000,000 Russian civilians--that the person who made that claim had minimized the Holocaust and therefore, by one point of their definition, that statement was anti-semitic.  

I asked them to respond.  They did not respond but they did remove that point from their definition.  (And I am not claiming they changed that in response to my email--maybe they got dozens of emails about that point.)  I did not even know they had removed that point until the other day when I saw it was no longer there.  And I think the 9,000,000 includes Russian POWS--I can't remember.  I will stipulate that I will accept all claims that I have it wrong.  I did not recheck anything about the 9,000,000 and I don't even know if I used 9,000,000 in my email--but it must have been more than 6,000,000.   My experience with the most right wing Jews is that they can be very reasonable and even agreeable.  They *can be* reasonable.  I am not claiming they are *always* reasonable.

Thanks for taking a look at this and I look forward to reading responses.

Note:  I tagged this ""Realities of War"" because was no tag for ""Realities of War Crimes"".



**Footnote:**

This is for anybody who wants to read about war mongering Christians in SC:

The Holy Bibles of these war mongering Christians say that the Jews are God's chosen people and their preachers preach that to them regularly.  They are about 100% supportive of Israel no matter what.  I know Jews who are not supportive at all of Israel.  There is no variance that I know of amongst these war mongering Christians.

Southern fundamentalist Christianity puts equal emphasis on the Old Testament and the New Testament, or maybe more.  As they believe that every word of the Bible is the literal word of that great gunslinger in the sky, and so no part of it is more important than any other to them.  They probably spend more time in the Old Testament than the New Testament, maybe because there is way more violence.

Their belief that the Jews are God's chosen people--that belief is just as important as any belief they hold  about Jesus Christ.  They are also very patriotic, and since the passage of the voting rights acts and the civil rights acts in 1965, they have voted Republican even when they have been aware that voting Democratic is more in their economic interests.

Their racism is way more important to them than their economic well being.  Their ideas civil rights clash with the ideas of the Democratic Party on civil rights.  One even told me, ""I believe Mike Daniels (D) would be the best governor, but I am voting for Carrol Campbell (R) because he will do a better job at keeping \[Blacks\] in their place.""  (He did not say ""Blacks"":  he said a word that starts with an N that is known as ""the N word"".

South Carolina's war mongering Christians believe in war.  That may be because the LORD their God is so much in favor of war in the Old Testament.  The LORD their God wiped out the entire planet except for Noah and his family, he wiped out all of the firstborn in Egypt, and ordered the Israelites to wipe out the men, women and the children of this or that enemy.  That is, the LORD their God sometimes orders genocide.  

Once when I went to Sunday School with this woman I liked--I asked the Sunday school teacher, ""What about when Jesus said to love your enemies and to turn the other cheek?""

The Sunday School teacher broke it down to where even I could understand it.  He said, ""You are ignoring the historical context.  What Jesus said applied at the time he said it.  At that time Israel was ruled by the Romans.  The Romans were their enemy.  If they didn't act like they loved the Romans, the Romans could just take a sword and run one of them through.  And if a Roman slapped a Jew in the face, if Jew did want to see his guts spilled out in the dirt, he had to turn the other cheek.  What Jesus said was good advice at that time.""

I was with this woman I was sweet on, and I probably would have gone with her any place she asked me to.  I was not going to blow it with her so I just nodded my head like I now understood, like he had broke it down where I could understand it.  

The second time she asked me to go to Sunday School and church with her a month later, the Sunday School teacher started carrying on about evolution.

I asked, ""What about all those dinosaur bones they find out in the desert?""

He broke it down for me again.

""The Devil and his demons are out to deceive you and lead you astray.  You know that, right?  Demons put those bones out there to deceive you.  The Devil wants to burn you in hell.  God loves you and God wants you to be in heaven with us.  The Bible is the word of God, and God says he created this world in 7 days.  Who are you going to believe, God or the Devil?""

""God.  I believe God.  But I am not clear on one thing:  God gave us reason and sensory experience.  Did God put us in a world where we can't trust our senses or the reason he gave us?""

""God also gave us free will.  That means that you can choose to go to heaven or hell.  It boils down to this:  Are you going to believe your senses and your reason or are you going to believe God?  God could be testing you to see what you will choose.  And when you follow your senses over the word of God, you stray off the straight and narrow and into the wilderness where the Devil roams.  Are you going to trust your senses and your reason, or God?""

""I am going to trust God.""  I said that answer because something about her did it for me and I wasn't going to blow it in some Sunday School class.  I was 32 at that time and she was 26.  I am 66 now and I still speak with her pretty often.

I have not even gone into what the preacher preached about.  And this was at the biggest church in Columbia, a Southern Baptist church with over 5,000 members.   Both times I went her parents asked me to Sunday dinner, which was also wild.  I mean, they are good people, but it was wild.  I answered their questions in a way that left them satisfied I was going to heaven, and so I didn't have to keep going to church there because I was seeing her outside of church by then and because I had to be at my church, an Episcopal Church that I did go to about once every three months.  She had told me that her mother called them ""Whiskypalians.""  At Sunday dinner when they asked me what kind of church I went to I said, ""Episcopalian.  But the priest keeps a bottle of liquor in this liquor cabinet in his office, so sometimes I refer to the church as 'Whiskypalian.""  Her mother laughed and said, ""I have heard it called that.""   I explained that the priest had to deal with upset people sometimes and that the priest was not a slop drunkard.  ""I don't know to have ever taken a drink, but when I saw his liquor cabinet I did ask about it.""  I described Father Rose as a good, holy man and didn't tell them that he got so many tickets he had to get a radar detector.  He told me he got the tickets speeding between hospitals to see sick people and to give last rites.  (Episcopalian churches don't generally do last rites or do confession but there are some that do everything the Catholics do--known as ""high church"".  High church is not related to upper class in any way.  The more high church, the more lower class people go there.  One last thing:  Episcopalians are as to the left as they can get, and they are not war mongers and they don't bother people with nonsense about whether or not they are saved and going to heaven.  A Southern Baptist will sit you down at a table and pull out a piece of paper and a pencil and draw diagrams to explain to you what you have to do to get to heaven and what happens if you don't do it.  One more thing:  Southern Baptists despise all Muslims because Muslims are heathens who worship a false God.  On the other hand, the weekly program (a piece of paper that gives the order of service)--I remember when the program quoted Muhammad one time.  A Southern Baptist will never believe you when you tell them that Muslims have way more respect for Christianity than Jews do.  Last thing:  I have been present on two occasions when a Southern Baptist got out his piece of paper and worked with a Jew.  That was funnier than any Saturday Night Live skit I ever saw.  Both times the Jew was with me and the Southern Baptist would try to get me to help him get the Jew into heaven.  They probably went home and told their wives that I was so sorry that I didn't care either way if the Jew burned in hell for eternity or went to heaven.  (Their doctrine is absurd and a 5 year old child has a higher sense of morality.)  They believe God created this world and it was so screwed up that God worked out plan to save the world.  God said, ""I will send my Son down there and put all their sins on him as if he participated in all their perversions and when I kill him, I can bring them up to heaven if they believe this insane story.  And they carry on about how much God loved his Son and how it grieved God to kill him, but God loved us and it was the only way God could save him.  They have told me, ""God loved you so much that his son died for your sins.  God loved you that much that he let his son die for you.""  I have said, ""Lookhere, I have never done anything that a hanging South Carolina judge would give me more than 30 days for.""  That doesn't matter--if you sin once, you are a sinner.  And they act like God lost his son for me.  ""Wait a minute,"" I said, ""I thought Jesus went back up to heaven and sits at the right hand of God.""  They can't disagree because they  claim that too. 

It is insane.  No wonder the Jews think Christianity is insane.  Jews think Christianity is insane because most versions are absolutely insane.  I love talking about it with Jews I know.

So, first of all, why people claim that Israel people (zionists) are like rizzuans, when litteraly Palestine (or Arabic countries) practically always attacked first, had ultraright takes, even right after peace agreements? Like, where Israel people suppose to live to please everyone then, especially since apparently Palestine agreed on Oslo peace proceed? If these territories didn't please them, why don't keep negotiating instead of attacking Israel's border in 7th October? It's wrong to compare two different wars, but in case of Ukraine they tried to negotiate diplomatically about territories until one, no 150 million fckers, decided to occupy more territory. Srry, went in wrong direction.

Americans are absolutely clueless on Israel-Palestinian conflict. Empty vessels make the most noise. They dont know enough about the conflict, but that sure as h**** not going to hinder them exercising their first amendment rights, hence making them the noisiest.

What the h*** happened ? Have Americans been living in a cave for the past 70 years ? How on earth could someone not know about Israel and Palestine before October 7th ? It is one of the oldest conflict that is still ongoing. Were they just born yesterday ? Have they been spending their time following the Kardashians all these time ? I would forgive the North Koreans for not knowing about the Israel-Palestinian conflict, they probably didnt have access to world news. I would forgive the Chinese for not fully understanding the Israel-Palestinian conflict, living behind the Great Fire Wall, they just see what the Chinese government wants them to see. But Americas, at least they are free, nobody is stopping any Americans from heading to their local library and borrowing a book to read about this conflict or researching about this conflict. 

Americans werent like that in the past, there were many really smart and brilliant Americans. They used to be very interested in learning and many were leaders and pioneers in their fields. Where is the critical thinking ? Have they even read a book on this conflict or are they just watching tiktok ? But now, I dont know anymore, it kinda lost its edge. 

It felt like this Are you smarter than a 5th Grader question https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8pnec4Hxps

Initially, I thought it was the public school system in USA was the failure. It’s only the poorer Americans who went to public schools who arent that bright that are clueless. Then the Colombia University campus protest happened, and other Ivy leagues campuses joined in….these are supposed to be the brightest and smartest American students. Even the smartest Americans students appear clueless,….

1. Were you surprised the Americans are so clueless on this 70 years+ Israel-Palestinian conflict ? 

2. Were you disappointed in how Americans reacted ? 

3. What do you think of American Jews ? They seem equally clueless on the history of Israel. Does it surprise you American Jews dont understand Israel ? There are even American Jews who actively join the protest movement. I am not talking about those American Jews with funny hats, the more secular American Jews but equally clueless. 

P/s: i use the word clueless but i think another way to describe it is parallel world (they appear to live in different dimension world where historical events were different to our common understanding). Or an upside down world I guess, where they would defend Hamas or defend Hezbollah, both terrorist organizations according to the US government.

To win, all Hamas has to do is preserve 10% of their forces in some corner of Gaza and wait, maybe a year, maybe two, then re-emerge as the strongest local force in the area and drive out the Israeli occupation force or whatever amalgamated international or makeshift Palestinian force is in place. Hamas at 10% strength would still be the strong force in the area. At some point, Israel will want to get back to normal, build the economy, do art and science, travel, and be done. Hamas will never be done. If all the leaders are dead, their weaponry is down to bare bones supplies, most of the fighters a new untrained recruits, that have been in the shadow for years, they can always take Gaza back and declare victory.

The only ways to actually defeat Hamas are 1) IDF occupation at high strength indefinitely, checkpoints, biometric data, and 10 years of slow patient colonialism which the world will hate; 2) some local Palestinian strong man/force willing to collaborate with Isreal and take on Hamas as seriously as the Egyptian military would deal with the Muslim Brotherhood and take its' lumps in public opinion for being allied to Israel...

Unfortunately for Israel, all options for true victory are impossible, and therefore Hamas will re-emerge in a few years and this war will have been for nothing. No international force has the stomach to withstand terrorist attacks. No local agent is willing to be tarred publicly as a collaborator. The IDF cannot stay and rule Gaza- the Israeli public will tire of direct rule, the world will condemn Israel.

Israel will have to go back to two-state/federation negotiations vis a vis the West Bank. Something outside the box - new leadership in both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, a revolution in Iran, a dramatic engagement by the US that is not in lock step with Isreal - something will have to change. The clock is running for the Hamas victory lap in a couple of years and a breakthrough in the West Bank might change the calculations in time for Isreal to hold Gaza for a year or so.

As of now, Hamas is winning this war by continuing to exist. They have lost operation control of the north? Doesn't matter. They have lost 1/4 of their forces. Doesn't matter. Their metric of victory is to avoid destruction and stay more or less organized.

I wish it were otherwise but this does seem to the way I see it.

Edit: Some comments by Israelis here below have me concerned. In Iraq, the Bush administration was moronic. The invasion itself was stupid, then to disband the army and try to occupy the country on the cheap compounded the stupid with more stupid. In the end, the US wasted the lives of its citizens and tremendous amounts of money to improve the strategic position of Iran. But the US is huge and far away and could brush off even this most idiotic of stupid unforced errors. 

Israel cannot afford this kind of mistake. Bibi is not to be trusted. The occupation necessary to achieve a lasting improvement in Isreal's security is not tolerable internationally. Isreal cannot stand isolation, at least not the society as it exists now. It's not an easy situation and there are dangers here to the kind of place Isreal is and will be.

&gt; Enrique Pineyro, an Argentine-Italian actor, director and social activist, had to remove protest messages against the Iranian regime from his private Boeing 787 airplane to be allowed to land in Egypt and deliver humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

&gt; Pineyro, nicknamed the ""Michael Moore of Argentina"" for his politically critical artwork over the years, acquired the plane in 2021 from the Mexican national airline AeroMexico, and has since used it, among other things, for humanitarian activism, conducting flights to Ukraine and Afghanistan and assisting in evacuating residents from war zones.

&gt; Three sentences mentioning the protest against the Iranian regime are printed on the plane's fuselage: ""No woman should be forced to cover her head,"" ""No woman should be killed for not covering her head,"" and ""No man should be hanged for saying this."" 

&gt; Additionally, one of the aircraft's tail wings bears the image of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested and brutally killed by Tehran's morality police in September 2022, leading to massive protests brutally suppressed by the regime. The other side of the plane's tail features the image of Iranian footballer Amir Reza Nasr Azadani, who was sentenced to 26 years in prison for participating in protests against the regime.",worldnewsvideo,2024-01-01 13:40:48,18vvrra,ps1AzSu6NG,0,18,0,True,2022-12-29 18:48:02,37.0,0.0,13351.0,6759.0,20147.0,358,,"Because it had a picture of Zhina (Mahsa) Amini, a plane from Argentina to Egypt to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza was told at an Egyptian airport: “We won’t let you deliver the items unless you remove the picture!”",0.91,358,0,2024-01-01 12:25:31

This is why I don't think he cares about the hostages or what happens to them in fact he would throw them in a boiling lake of the many who would stay in power forever.

The hostages are nothing more than excuses and propaganda pieces to continue the war for as long as possible, for as long as the war is going he stays in power and doesn't go to jail.

Hamas is responsible for October 7th. But Netanyahu and IDF ignored signs that it was going to happen because he was too busy trying to kill Israeli democracy and subjugating the West Bank. Even now his coalition is using the time they have left to shape Israel into an illiberal democracy and turn it into something like Hungary or Poland. Ben Gvir is even openly wishing Donald Trump would be put back in office so that they can do whatever they want. Trump was the most dangerous and unstable President in modern history and it speaks volumes when the Israeli government is hoping he returns.

 “ Israel ignored the many orders of UN Security Council to withdraw from the occupied arab lands. It continued to persecute the arab Palestinian people , committing massacres against them consistently. Israel also continued to desecrated the holy Aqsa mosque. All this pushed the Palestinian resistance movement to break into the Israeli settlements surrounding the Gaza strip on October 7th. They captured many hostages, both settlers and IDF soldiers, which lead the Israeli enemy to retaliate violently by completely destroying the Gaza Strip. Tens of thousands were martyred and injured, the infrastructure was destroyed, including schools, mosques, churches and residential units.. “ 

Very conveniently eliminating all the atrocities Hamas committed on that day , especially the violent killing of 400+ music festivals goers, while explicitly addressing the details of Israels reaction. Not to mention the subtle excusing of why Hamas attacked in the first place. 
Also note the subtle use of words like “the resistance movement” , the “ Israeli enemy “  and “ massacres “ .. when Jordan is a country that has long signed treaties with Israel. 

How does a text like this, taught to 10th graders, serve the cause of peace and coexistence ? If anything it fuels the deep rooted hatred in the region, in a country where &gt;40% of the residents are of Palestinian origin!

People are literally killing the economy by these boycotts, while affecting the mother “American and Jewish” companies with little to nothing.. That’s how blinded by hatred they are 🤦🏻‍♀️

I make a comment about the post, I of course get attacked and called all kinds of names, and logic is lost on the people who see validation of their limited beliefs in texts like these.

I came here to Israel in 1979 just to see what the fuss was all about and just immediately clicked with the culture, country and people despite coming from a totally secular (atheist ) home. I never left. I married and had kids here, and despite all the difficulties here (including the current government) it's my home and I could never leave.

Normally, I'd post this in the Israel subreddit because I feel my views would be better understood there and less criticized. However, I wanted to try this subreddit to vent and hear different perspectives.

Since the Jewish migration to the Middle East and the establishment of Israel, Jews have faced significant hostility, primarily from Arabs but also non-Arabs. We've been told to go back to Europe and that we don’t belong in the Middle East. We've received bomb threats that have taken place from groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran, among other terrorist organizations. Jews have endured this hostility for nearly a century.

Before anyone misconstrues my words, I'm not claiming that Israel is completely innocent or blameless. I'm here to discuss Israel and our struggles as Israeli and Jews. I want to talk about the violent behavior of pro-Palestinian groups, particularly pro-Palestinian Arabs towards Israelis and Jews worldwide. The Israel-Palestine issue is incredibly complex and long-standing with many facets so It’s frustrating when people try to shift all the blame onto Israel while ignoring the terrorist attacks by groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and terrorist organizations in the Middle East and I will list a few examples here to back up my point. 

1) **The Hebron Massacre**

The Hebron massacre took place on August 24, 1929, in the city of Hebron when a large number of Arab rioters targeted the Jewish community. The incident was fueled by false rumors and propaganda that claimed Jews intended to seize control of the Temple Mount. It was reported by investigators that there was extreme level of violence and brutality including rape, torture and mutilation of the body. It was estimated that between 67 to 70 Jews lost their lives at the hands of Arab attackers during this massacre.


2) **Yon Kippur Surprise Attack**

The Yom Kippur War started on October 6 and ended on October 25, 1973. Yom Kippur is the holiest day in the Jewish calendar and it is a time when Jews fast, pray, and refrain from work, making it a period of vulnerability due to the slower pace of life. On this day, Egyptian and Syrian forces launched a surprise attack on Israel knowing that the country would be off guard. The war was intense with heavy casualties on both sides. Israel faced attacks on multiple fronts and was on the brink of defeat but managed to counterattack effectively due to fast mobilization and smart thinking. The outcome of the war and who won is debated; some claim Israel won while others argue Egypt did but the main point is that Arab countries chose to attack Israel on Yom Kippur because they knew it was a good time to take advantage of the Jewish holy day to end as much lives as possible. (Yet somehow we’re the evil ones?) Israel suffered approximately 2,600 casualties which is a significant loss.

3)**Tel Aviv-Jerusalem 405 Suicide attack**

This happened on July 6, 1989 during the First Intifada. Abd al-Hadi Ghanim, a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad carried out the attack. The bus was traveling from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem off course by Ghanim. He took the steering wheel while shouting ""Allah Akbar (God is great)” and drove the bus through the safety barrier, sending it down a ravine. The bus rolled multiple times, spilling passengers out  and tearing apart before landing upside down and bursting into flames. The attack resulted in 14 deaths and 27 injuries including five American tourists who were among the injured.

4)**October 7th**

On October 7, Hamas and the Iran-backed terror group carried out an unprovoked attack on Israel. They slaughtered babies, raped women, burned whole families alive, and took hundreds of innocent civilians hostage. Since October 7, more than 1,200 Israelis have been killed and terrorists are still holding 132 men, women, and children in captivity.

Of course, there have many other attacks conducted on Israel but I'm going to stop here for now. I brought up these examples because people are always quick to talk about what Jews have done to Palestinian Arabs, but they never talk about what Palestinian Arabs or other Arabs have done to Jews. It really frustrates me because everyone is always painting Palestinians and Arabs as the victims and making Jews look like the enemy that are responsible for everything. The world doesn't seem to hold them accountable for anything; instead, they let them play the victim card and they end up believing they are the victims and they go on believing they are the victims without ever facing the truth. People also continue to deny the horrific acts that Hamas committed against innocent Israeli civilians on October 7th (despite evidence) but when Hamas reports that 2000 Palestinians died, people will easily believe it without questioning the authenticity of those numbers. It’s unfair. 

I used to be really hopeful and optimistic. I genuinely believed that one day Jews and Arabs could live peacefully together. Even after October 7th, I tried to stay optimistic and hoped for peace between Arabs and Jews. But lately, I'm starting to realize that might not be possible. From the moment Arabs are born, they are indoctrinated to hate Jews and see us as the enemy while they are the heroes. They're told that destroying Israel is their ultimate goal and that taking Jewish lives is a badge of honor. 

I've tried talking to Arabs but because I'm Jewish, they've been incredibly hateful. They've called me things like ""Jewish bastard"" and ""baby killer."" I've received death threats, and some have told me that Hitler should have killed all Jews and when he had the chance. They've told me they want to kill all Jews and shoot Jewish babies. It's been so awful that I’m tearing up just writing this. What's ironic is that they follow Islam, the ""religion of peace” yet they talk to me, another human being, in such a hateful way.

I've come to realize that it Arabs have never really wanted peace with Jews since we moved to the Middle East. No matter how much Jews try to get along and understand them, they don't want to do the same for us. Arabs often tell Jews that the IDF has massacred thousands of Palestinians or that Jews are occupying Palestinian land. They say Palestinians are defending themselves and explain why Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran are the good guys for carrying out terrorist attacked on Israel but when we try to share our side of things and talk about what Palestinians and other Arab countries have done to us, their ears and eyes are close and they completely shut us out. They don’t listen at all because deep down, they don’t want peace or negotiation. They just want to keep blaming Israel for everything because it fits their narrative that Jews are the enemy and the oppressors. 

I thought I had a friend from Oman who was different. I’ve had a hard time liking Arabs because of how they’ve treated me but this guy seemed different. When we first met, I asked him his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He said he was neutral and admitted that Palestinians weren’t innocent and had done bad things too. I was so happy and shocked because I'd never met an Arab who was this open-minded and willing to criticize Palestine. We became really close friends. 

But today, we had a big argument. He sent me a video of Jews supporting Palestine and captioned it, ""These are the people I support. The people who want to stop the genocide."" That made me upset because it showed he was clearly supporting Palestine and was praising those Jews because they were on Palestine side while basically disapproving of Jews who didn’t support Palestine. He also said Israel was committing ethnic cleansing. Prior to this, he would occasionally say that Israel had stolen Palestinian land but I ignored it because I valued our friendship and didn’t want to ruin it. But today, it was too much. He was blaming Israel for everything—why Palestinians are suffering, why they don’t have a proper state, why they lack basic infrastructure, and more. I couldn’t take it anymore.

When I called him out, he tried to gaslight me, pretending he was still neutral and a peace activist. But I could see through it; I knew he clearly supported Palestine but just wasn’t willing to admit it. So, I ended up cutting him off because I realized he’s just like the other Arabs. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if someone supports Palestine. That’s not the issue. The problem was that he was faking his neutrality instead of being honest about his support for Palestine. Another issue was that he was very closed-minded and uneducated on the topic. He blindly supported Palestine because that's what most Arabs do—they don't learn the full history, just the Palestinian side and become very biased. Even when I tried to educate him, he wouldn’t listen and kept gaslighting me so I decided to block him and cut him off completely.

Before anyone jumps in to agree with him and say that Israel is the reason why Palestine are suffering and haven’t developed a proper state, I’d like to debunk those claims. Palestinians have had plenty of chances to build a better life and develop their society. Since 1950, the United States has provided them with over $11 billion and another $6 million has been given to the UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency). Yet, despite all this aid, Palestine hasn’t seen significant development. Many still live in refugee camps which are essentially just small, cramped apartments. Their government is incredibly corrupt and fascist. They have no freedom of speech or religion. Hamas uses the money to purchase weapons for their terrorist activities rather than investing it into the country for development. But instead of taking responsibility and working to improve their situation, they continue to blame Israel for everything.

Another frustrating thing is that pro-Palestinian supporters are allowed to say extremely disgusting and antisemitic things to Jews and it’s considered acceptable. Racism towards Jews has become so normalized that no one speaks up for us anymore. In fact, people often join in and support the hate. I rarely see pro-Israel people attacking pro-Palestinians with such vile words and comments. But many of us in Israel including myself have been told by pro-Palestinians that they wish we were raped or dead among other horrible things. It’s just so exhausting and disheartening.

I’ve tried to talk to Arabs to maybe find some common ground and understanding but they don’t aren’t interested in that. They just want Jews gone so they can have the land to themselves but we’re not going anywhere. They can keep complaining because that’s what they seem to do best instead of seeking peace as their religion teaches.

I’m just so tired of it all. The world is cruel and unjust towards Jews. I can’t help but wonder what we did to deserve this kind of treatment. Why are we so hated? Why are we constantly used as scapegoats and targeted with conspiracy theories to fuel more hate against us? Why can’t we just live our lives like normal people? There’s something new every day that people create about Jews and I’m just so sick and tired of it. No other group has to deal with this kind of constant hatred and behavior except us. It’s unfair.

IDF had admitted to accidentally killing them amidst the battle in Shajaia- Shajaia is a major hub of battles right now and Palestinian civilians are instructed by the IDF to keep out of there, so all who stay there are assumed Hamas terrorists.

IDF thinks that the three hostages either escaped their captors or were released by them- mid-battle.

The IDF fighters there were on high alert, after serval days of battle and encountering suicide bombers with no visible weapons and many traps set by Hamas, and shot them once they saw them running.

After the battle they saw the three bodies and suspected them to be hostages so they were brought to Israel for identification and were confirmed.

It is a very tragic end to those hostages who I thought a lot of people had assumed would eventually happen with the cynical use of civilians by Hamas, their desperation, and the dwindling fighting areas that are being left as the IDF marches forward and clearing the tunnels and neighborhoods from Hamas.

Urban warfare is a tragic tail, the lives of many families are forever changed, but it just heightens the importance of eradicating Hamas imo so things like that will never happen again.

Is he under the impression that he wont dislodge Hamas, then what would be the rattionale  for this war. Especially considering that the ICCJ recently ruled that genocide is plausibly happening. What is so important to Israel for them to muddy the lines to being a pariah state. 

Why would Palestinian statehood be against Israel best interest, I'm finding it hard to grapple with this. what interest are we talking about because the denial of statehood breeds resistance which by itself present a heightened sense of danger to Israeli lives, This is literally the position hat the UK has taken on this subject matter.

 Just a good example I thought of how easy it is to spin things without context. I see this so often in those spaces - a photo of a crying man and text that he had to operate on his son with no anesthesia, a photo of a sad old couple looking at a house and text saying their house was stolen by Israelis, a photo of a soldier with his hand on the shoulder of a child and text like IDF attacks children on their way to school etc. I have no idea what is true and what isnt but I think this stuff is so dangerous bc you can literally write anything you want on a picture. So much of the content in those spaces is emotional images with no context. And people share these things so readily. Also maybe someone can confirm but isn't Quds a Hamas propoganda site? I suspect that a lot of these sources and bots you see online are backed by Quatari or Iranian sponsors or at the very least Hamas themselves could be pouring money into it, we know funding is no problem for them. Why wouldn't they? They cannot win militarily but this disruption to the West is immensely beneficial to their cause. For Hamas it helps them demand a ceasefire which means they remain in power and for the Iranian-Russian axis the West putting pressure on the US to stop supporting their ally in the middle east is a perfect play on the geopolitical scene. And conditions in the West have made this so easy bc the world is now seen as black and white - oppressor and oppressed- villain and hero and people are comfortable trying to fit an extremely complex into a story of white colonialism. 

 I also know a lot of pro Palestinian sources try to lay on the idea that Israeli hasbara is some kind of master operation. It is so off base in my opinion. European/ American governments support Israel not bc of some mysterious Jewish influence but bc they are part of the American European axis against countries that are hostile to the West (like Iran-Russia) and therefore a strategic ally. Israel did try to found and fund efforts to improve their image especially after the first intifada, of course there is an effort. There's a foreign communication minister in the government. you can see the videos the IDF tried to release from the tunnels but they were sloppy and there was a lot of backlash so it seems they've stopped with that tactic. Overall the effort put into defending themselves online has been pretty weak. In fact Israel has been pretty much focused solely on the war and a good number of the public statements made were not directed at the West at all but we're intended as war trash talk towards Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran- something that seems to characterize military engagement in the middle east and doesn't translate well internationally. A big reason is Israel just assumes the whole world hates them bc of antisemitism and there is no point. Possibly a huge error on their part.

And never mind the fact that the author of the story herself works with an organization known to have ties to Hamas - Euro-Med Monitor where she is a Strategy Director. Euro-Med Monitor is believed by many to be essentialy run by Hamas, with many employees publically supporting the 10/7 attacks.

And never mind the numerous inconsistencies in the story: Israel, the author would argue, is supposedly a genocidal entity hellbent on killing Palestinians en masse, but instead of just bombing buildings entirely, they play a game where they use tiny quadcopters playing sounds of screaming women and children to lure people out.

They have supposed video of these types of incidents where the sound definitely doesn't seem like its coming from a distant quadcopter. And yet no video of the supposed injuries

It is of course full of lies, both recent and historic, which you can review at your displeasure. Of particular interest is their description of the 10/7 attack itself.

&gt;  Avoiding harm to civilians, especially children, women and elderly people is a religious and moral commitment by all the Al-Qassam Brigades’ fighters. We reiterate that the Palestinian resistance was fully disciplined and committed to the Islamic values during the operation and that the Palestinian fighters only targeted the occupation soldiers and those who carried weapons against our people. In the meantime, the Palestinian fighters were keen to avoid harming civilians despite the fact that the resistance does not possess precise weapons.

&gt; Video clips taken on that day – Oct. 7 – along with the testimonies by Israelis themselves that were released later showed that the Al-Qassam Brigades’ fighters didn’t target civilians, and many Israelis were killed by the Israeli army and police due to their confusion.

And

&gt; The suggestion that the Palestinian fighters committed rape against Israeli women was fully denied including by the Hamas Movement. A report by the Mondoweiss news website on Dec. 1, 2023, among others, said there is lack of any evidence of “mass rape” allegedly perpetrated by Hamas members on Oct. 7 and that Israel used such allegation “to fuel the genocide in Gaza.”

Hamas denies entirely that a) civilians were targeted and killed and b) that any Palestinians raped any women.

[The Washington Post reported yesterday that similar arguments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/21/hamas-attack-october-7-conspiracy-israel/?utm_source=alert) are going around the pro-Palestine movement in the West. 

&gt; “Israel murdered their own people on October 7,” said Christina Gutierrez, an analyst in the city’s housing department, where some in the crowd shouted “antisemitism isn’t real.”

&gt; The head of International Relations for Hamas, Basem Naim, has falsely asserted that the group “didn’t kill any civilians” when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, calling the claim “Israeli propaganda.”

&gt; “Despite how it can appear sometimes I don’t actually have an axe to grind with the Jews,” said Owen Benjamin, a comedian who embraces far-right and antisemitic content, in a November post on X. “It’s just the insane Holocaust narrative and fake war atrocities by shoved down our throats as Americans by israel needs constant pushback,” he wrote in apparent reference to the atrocities of Oct. 7.

10/7 occurred less than six months ago, and for a long time, the murder and killings of Israeli civilians were cheered and praised by the pro-Palestine movement. Now, perhaps as the heady joy dissipates, the realization that maybe it's not the greatest idea to cheer for murdered  and raped Jews is finally occurring to the anti-Israelis. 

But of course, Palestine and the pro-Palestinian movement are never wrong and never capable of making mistakes. There's no room for apologizing or introspection or making amends. No, instead, the entire history of 10/7 must be rewritten to exonerate Hamas for absolutely everything. Civilians certainly were not killed on 10/7. Women were definitely not raped. 

And of course, if you disagree with the Palestinian narrative, you know what you're going to be called. 

Numerous mainstream newspapers and media outlets have confirmed the deaths and rapes of Israeli civilians on 10/7. There are numerous websites in which Hamas' crimes have been documented and archived. You can review them below.

2. The biggest allies in the middle east are: Turkey, Israel, Egypt snd Saudi Arabia. Lately they have all been pursuing various forms of aggressive nationalism. Israel has already codified religious chauvinism and exclusivism, and some of its leaders regularly incite terrorism and call for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the West Bank.

In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has fostered a new culture of hyper-nationalism in an attempt to diminish the influence of the religious establishment and build by coercive means a Saudi national identity revolving around his authoritarian persona.

In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is known for stirring up a version of aggressive Turkish nationalism, laced with religious overtones and mixed with Ottoman revivalism in his frequent campaigns of grievances and intimidation against the West. Erdogan projects himself as the embodiment of these corrosive values. And in Egypt, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s decade-long reign has been the most autocratic and disastrous in modern Egyptian history.

Putin had a better relationship with Israel than the US.

3. Cash Flow Financing 
Section 23 of the AECA (22 U.S.C. §2763) authorizes the President to finance the “procurement 
of defense articles, defense services, and design and construction services by friendly foreign 
countries and international organizations, on such terms and conditions as he may determine 
consistent with the requirements of this section.” Successive Administrations have used this 
authority to permit Israel to utilize FMF funds to finance multiyear purchases in advance 
appropriations, rather than having to pay the full amount of such purchases up front (see text box 
below). Known as “cash flow financing,” this benefit enables Israel to negotiate major arms 
purchases with U.S. defense suppliers with payments scheduled over a longer time horizon.51

What international laws is Israel violating? IDF is the most moral army on earth. Will the Brits ever suspend any sales to Palestine or sanction Hamas?

Im sorry if it uses weird language sometimes)

Tonight, 23th of March 2024, accompanied by a close friend, we drove to Belgium for a bit of exploration. We stumbled upon the abandoned station in As online, where trains still linger. Upon arriving at the location, something immediately caught our attention: noises emanating from the premises. Initially, we presumed it to be a distant rock concert, given the thuds we first heard. However, upon scaling the fence, we realized the source was much closer than anticipated. Behind the trains stood a warehouse, shrouded in darkness; this is where the sound originated. What initially resembled rock music now took on a much darker tone. I struggle to describe the sound other than likening it to the eerie sound effects from a horror film. It ceased being music; rather, it became a kind of profoundly dark ambient noise, evoking a sense of malevolence. Keep in mind, this was around 10:00 PM on a Saturday night—an odd time for activity at an abandoned station. 

Upon our arrival, we observed people walking within one of the trains. We crouched down and observed until they exited the train, then proceeded directly to the warehouse, wielding flashlights in the darkness. Intrigued, we decided to investigate further, approaching the train from which they emerged, on the right side facing from the forest. This afforded us our first clear view of the warehouse. All was dark; no windows were visible, but a faint glimmer of light emanated from beneath the large sliding door. The prolonged duration of the noises only heightened the tension. Approximately 40 minutes were spent at this location. Suddenly, we noticed the flashlights approaching our direction coming from the traintracks. We hastily retreated, watching from a safe distance as they returned to the train, this time remaining outside. They were just looking around. As if they might have heard us. I am positive they have not seen us this night. After a brief interval, they departed once more, captured on film.

Feeling thoroughly unnerved by the unsettling sounds resonating in the darkness of the abandoned station, adjacent to the forest, my friend and I resolved to investigate once more. Proceeding cautiously, we positioned ourselves beside the warehouse, where the sound became distinctly clearer. Intermittently, we heard loud thuds, reminiscent of heavy metal colliding. There still was this dark eerie sound constantly changing tones and frequency. However, the last sound I heard defies description—I have it recorded on film. The last clip, entirely shrouded in darkness, captures this moment. When filming we were standing right next to the warehouse. It sounded akin to the startup sequence of a powerful weapon or the ignition of a jet engine. This peculiar sound was followed by a resounding thud. Pausing briefly, we then observed the return of the flashlights. This time, we sprinted back to our cars, bewildered by the experience. After a brief discussion, we decided to make one final attempt.

Approaching the premises again, we immediately noticed the absence of sound. Proceeding with utmost caution, we arrived at the warehouse to find the faint glimmer of light beneath the sliding door had vanished. Venturing to the opposite side of the warehouse, however, we found nothing. We walked around the warehouse. There was no road or path to walk on. Just dirt, mud and train tracks. At this moment we decided to leave, and when we were back at the car we started thinking what could this have been?

The individuals we saw walking were wearing blue overalls, indicating that they were not merely urban explorers casually observing. It is highly unlikely that these individuals were working on a Saturday evening in the dark. Had there been ordinary music playing, I would not have harbored any peculiar thoughts about this experience, but the sounds and the concealed location have prompted me to make this post. Is there anyone who can explain any of these sounds? Are there machines producing these sounds of which I am unaware? I must ascertain this before considering a return. I have footage of all the sounds, and the guys walking around the tracks. 

There is one more thing i’d like to add to this. There was a small building about 500-750 meters from the warehouse. There were 2 ladies cleaning dishes. We asked them what those sounds were coming from the train tracks. They told us they didn’t know what sounds we where talking about. When we asked if they know if there is people working there, they told us there are no people working there. We asked them if it is okay if we walked over the tracks to take a look, and they told us it is dangerous to go there.",Creepy encounter at an abandoned train station,0.94,1033,0,2024-05-12 09:35:59

I don't really see any other thing Israel could do. The majority of Gaza supports Hamas, seeing that they voted them into power. If Israel just ""frees Gaza"" Gaza will try to completely push Israel out of the middle east. So what can they do? 

The only answer is for Gaza to stop wanting to destroy Israel.

People might say that Israel should stop the bombings, which I agree with to an extent, but they aren't just targeting civilians. They are targeting Hamas leaders, and civilians are also very sadly getting killed.

Another issue is that Hamas isn't just a small group, it's the government of Gaza. It really is Gaza  to a large extent.

The only other options I see is for Israel to either stop they're invasion and continue suffering terrorists attacks and raids, or to only use ground operations to hunt down Hamas leaders, which isn't really a viable option. It would make it much much harder to get rid of Hamas that way, and they would probably end up losing or suffering mass casualties.

Edit: after seeing everyone's sides, I understand things slightly better now. Essentially, what I have got from this is that because Israel really hates Hamas and because Hamas is very spread out , Israel is being reckless about it causing innocent deaths, which needs to be changed.

kcjihz0,1,"&gt; 300k a 'remarkable' record? 

Yeah no I'm in agreement that is very intense.  They are clearly going way overboard and ignoring the rules regarding targeting non-military buildings.

Friendly reminder to my ""side"" on this.  It isn't if there is or they suspect use from Hamas.  It's whether they can justify that the destruction was worth the cost when considering its effects.  

That number isn't destroyed though.  It's high end of buildings that have received some sort of damage.  

However it is telling.  The original claim of not targeting civilians is holding up.  

Compared to a similar war with Myanmar and the Rohingyans militants several years ago, with Myanmar arguing it was trying to do similar as Israel in removing militants from the stateless civilians. Where the Myanmar army is far less strong and equiped, the civilians have routes to flee combat zones if they aren't targeted, buildings are more spread out and rural.  Yet we all hopefully acknowledge is a case of ethnic cleansing and genocide.  Aka civilians are the target.  

Myanmar with intent to attack and remove the population completely demolished a high 90% of buildings relying on soldiers engaging in arson not bombs, with them being spread out.

In Myanmar in beatings of Rohingyans during the conflict reached well into the 100,000s. Over 10,000 rapes, 40,000 people deliberately burnt.  No attempt to warn populations of arson or incoming attacks.  1000s of cases of going beyond killing of civilians but extremely brutal ways.  Large amount of mines and artillery guns planted in civillian escape routes. 

That's what a country can do when it's intent is to target civilians.  Despite being much harder to accomplish than Israel.  And you can only explain this by seeing Israel not coming with the intent as Myanmar did.  

And this is just the most recent similar war that devolved into genocide I can think of.  

&gt; Journalists, paramedics, aid workers deliberately shot? 

That is heavily common in war.  To the point medics can forgo identification in war.  It's never okay.  But that is a bar few have crossed in just war.  

We are seeing a country go all out and hyper aggressively trying to kill off militants.  We are not seeing what targeting civilians looks like.  

Israel would only have to come with the intent of genocide, to out genocide most genocides.  They absolutely have the situation where that would be the case.

I don't agree with people saying that history don't matter. History is the basis of any nation/country in the world. Basically a lot of countries which were colonized/occupied by big empires during the years, and at certain moment they declared independence. Let's look at the countries in the same area:

 **Jordan**: End of Ottoman Rule (1918): Jordan, then known as Transjordan, was part of the Ottoman Empire until the end of World War I. Following the defeat of the Ottomans, the region came under British influence.

Formal Declaration of Independence (May 25, 1946): Jordan formally declared its independence on May 25, 1946. Shortly after, it was admitted to the United Nations as a sovereign state.

**Lebanon** :  Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire for several centuries until the end of World War I. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1918 led to the collapse of their empire.

Declaration of Independence (1943): On November 22, 1943, Lebanon officially declared its independence. The French authorities initially reacted by arresting the Lebanese government leaders but released them under local and international pressure.  
  
Full Independence (1946): French troops withdrew completely from Lebanon in 1946, marking the full independence of the country.

**Syria**: End of Ottoman Rule (1918): Like many countries in the Middle East, Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire for centuries until its collapse at the end of World War I.

French Mandate (1920-1946): After the defeat of the Ottomans, the League of Nations granted France a mandate over Syria and Lebanon in 1920

Full Independence (April 17, 1946): Syria achieved full independence with the withdrawal of French troops on April 17, 1946. This date is celebrated annually as Syrian Independence Day.

**Iran**: Iran's path to independence and modern nationhood is complex and deeply rooted in its ancient and medieval history. Unlike many other countries in the Middle East, Iran (historically known as Persia) was never fully colonized by Western powers. 

Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911): This was a pivotal moment in Iran's history, where a popular movement led to the establishment of a parliament (the Majlis) and the drafting of a constitution. This reduced the absolute powers of the Shah and was aimed at modernizing and reforming the country, including limiting foreign influence.

**Iraq** British Mandate (1920-1932): Following the war, the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Iraq. This period was marked by British control and influence, with the establishment of a monarchy under King Faisal I, who was chosen by the British

Formal Independence (1932): Iraq gained formal independence from Britain on October 3, 1932, when it joined the League of Nations. While this marked the end of the British mandate, Britain continued to maintain significant influence in the country.

**Israel**: British Mandate of Palestine (1917-1948): Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the British took control of Palestine. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, expressed support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, while also noting that this should not prejudice the rights of existing non-Jewish communities.

Israel's declaration of independence in 1948 marked the establishment of a Jewish state in the Middle East.

The question which arise reading this historic facts is: why ""Palestine"" did not go for independence in the same period like the other countries in the area? My answer: because was not considered as country, nation or ethnicity at that moment. They were just Arab colonizers of historically Jewish land.

From another perspective, let's look at **LIBERIA**:

Early History and Foundation  
Pre-Colonial Period: Before the arrival of freed slaves, the region now known as Liberia was inhabited by various indigenous African peoples with their own distinct cultures and societies.  
  
American Colonization Society (ACS): In the early 19th century, the American Colonization Society was formed in the United States. This organization aimed to resettle freed African American slaves in Africa. The motivations behind this movement were mixed, involving both abolitionist sentiments and efforts by some to remove free blacks from American society.  
  
Establishment of the Colony (1822): The ACS began sending freed slaves to the Pepper Coast of West Africa in 1822. The first settlement was named Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States, who was a supporter of the colonization project.  
  
19th Century Developments  
Declaration of Independence (1847): Liberia declared independence on July 26, 1847, making it the first independent republic in Africa at that time. The Liberian Declaration of Independence was modeled after that of the United States.  
  
Constitution and Early Government: The Constitution, modeled after that of the U.S., established a republic with similar governmental institutions. The Americo-Liberians, as the settlers were known, dominated the political and economic life of the country, often marginalizing the indigenous populations.

Nobody have a problem with the former slaves coming back home and making their own country. They also have been forced in slavery, and when they had the opportunity they just returned home. Do you see the similarities with the Jewish people? 

And there are many similar examples: Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Baltic States, Kosovo etc.

Long story short, Jews just come back on their ancestors lands from all around the world, joined the existing Jews in that area, and they are 100% entitled to do so and defend against any kind of aggression. ",Tell me where I am wrong.,0.63,25,0,2023-12-30 19:35:36

To often arguments against Israel aren’t defences against genocide. But they are a denial of some past genocides
To be clear, I don’t believe that Israel as a state is committing genocide. But I am not an expert and could very much be wrong.

However, many of the arguments I see in this subreddit, aren’t actually defences against genocide. In fact, if used for some past genocides, these arguments would be a form of genocide denialism.

**But firstly, what is genocide?**

There are a few different definitions of genocides, but the UN’s is the most well known. So I will quote that [here](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml\)) 

&gt; Article II

&gt; In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

&gt; - Killing members of the group;

&gt; - Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

&gt; - Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

&gt; - Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

&gt; - Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

The key words that are often ignored here are “intent to destroy…”. Genocide does not have to kill (or harm) thousands of people. But thousands of people can die and an act still not be genocide. Controversial wars, like the  Iraq invasion of 2003, killed hundreds of thousands of people. But the invasion itself does not meet any definition of genocide.

An in depth [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n77DPJ7AE&amp;ab_channel=AndersPuckNielsen) of this argument was provided by a military analyst Anders Puck Nielsen on his YouTube Channel. Since I am not a war expert, but he is, his explanation is better. So please go check that out. 

I’m going to touch on some arguments either not mentioned by him or in a way that is more specific to arguments on this subreddit.

“**[Israel has no stated intention of committing genocide](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/183h8yc/seriously_stop_with_the_genocide_claims/)”**

(Not all the arguments in this post are bad. Some are quite good. Including some involving numbers)

As per the defiition above, and [Anders Puck Nielson’s video](https://youtu.be/L9n77DPJ7AE?t=165), genocide is an individual crime. It therefore also doesn’t have to be state policy or receive state approval. 

Also leaders can lie. Serbian leaders were denying the Bosnian genocide during the events. And they have continued to do so long[ after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide_denial). 

**The Palestinian Population has grown**

Genocide does not have to be an attempt to elimate an entire population. Thus why the words ""in part"" are included in the UN's definition. 

**[The number of Palestinians that have died is too small](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17anq9q/worst_genocide_like_ever/\))**

This is a horrific argument. Genocide is not a competition of death tolls. The Sabra and Shatila massacre (which involved Israeli and Lebanonese troops) killed anywhere between [hundreds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre\)) to [thousands](https://archive.org/details/israelinlebanonr0000inte/page/50/mode/2up?view=theater) of people in three days (The numbers vary greatly between sources, but it was probably in the thousands). At the highest estimates it was still lower than most of the examples cited by the user above. The UN and MacBride Commision both agreed it was a genocide despite the difficulty in determing the number of deaths.  

Also, a minority of comenters have compared the death toll of Palestinians to the Holocaust to prove they're are not victims of genocide. But the Holocaust was one of the worst genocides of all time. By insisting the death toll must be in the millions you are denying the Bosnian Genocide, the Yazidi Genocide and the cuurent genocide against Ukraine.

Finally, it’s possible that a group could try to commit a genocide and not have a large number of deaths. Genocide can be done by other means such as rape or kidnapping. ~~Which is the reason for~~ ~~Putin’s warrant (despite many Ukrainian deaths)~~ 

[Edit: My apologies, I misundersttod his arrest warrant. His [warrant](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and) is [for](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf) ""Unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement"" and ""Taking of hostages"" which could be considered [genocide](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/vladimir-putin-war-crimes-icc-arrest-warrant-ukraine-children) and Ukraine is arguing it is - but that's not in the warrant]


A group can also just not succeed very well in their attempt to commit genocide.

**Disproving genocide means you’ve found a good justification for the killing of civilians**

There’s no link for this one because no one says it directly. But several arguments are made on this subreddit where the user seems to think that by disproving the genocide claim. Israel’s actions must be regarded as completely right. That’s not the case. You can kill civilians unjustly and it still not be a genocide. In fact the UN states that there are [multiple war crimes] (https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/war-crimes.shtml) that involve unjustified harm or death to civilians but would not necessarily count as genocide. 


**Conclusion**

This is not an argument to suggest that Israel is in anyway committing a genocide or state-sponsered war crimes. Better[ posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18vah1e/hamas_are_parasites/) than mine have explained why no matter how Israel fights, some civilians will die. But I can't prove they're not either, and I'm not an expert who can determine that for sure.

My main paint is that bad arguments against claims of Israeli genocide can help actual denialists of other genocides feel more confident in their views.

Afterwards, the Israel-Palestine war (part of the larger [Arab-Israel conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict)) will be taken as a case study, in order to answer the question: *Is Israel a terroristic State?*

**Terrorism**: There is no academic/legal consensus on the [definition of terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism). In fact, there are scholars arguing[ why terrorism can, but should not be defined](https://readerslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/Why-terrorism-can-but-should-not-be-defined.pdf), exemplified by the sentence: *""one person’s freedom fighter is another person’s terrorist""*. Further details on this topic, however, would require a separate discussion, thus they are outside the scope of this thread. For our purposes, the intuitive understanding of terrorism will suffice, with the only remark that any actor (state or non-state) can be terroristic.

**State terrorism**: Historically, *State terrorism* is nothing new, e.g. the [Reign of Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror) is a classical example, but the contemporary academic discussion on the matter offers a deeper analytical perspective. Several definitions of State terrorism can be formulated, but, for the purpose of this thread, the following will suffice.

**Definition (State terrorism)**: *State terrorism is the use of disproportionate violence against a less powerful non-state actor with the intent to submit it to the state's political agenda.*

This definition has the following analytical requirements:

1. **State vs non-state**: State terrorism can only happen when you have a state actor acting against a non-state actor;
2. **Imbalance of power**: To qualify as ""terrorism"", the State needs to have superior power (i.e. more military capabilities) with respect to its non-state counterpart;
3. **Disproportionate violence**: The violence needs to be *disproportionate*, and note that this refers to the actual violence committed, so it is an *effects-based analysis*. Examples include sexual violence, torturing hostages, threats of using weapons of mass destruction, and generally any attacks generating *terror* in the non-state actor individuals;
4. **Submission**: The state actor goal is submission of the non-state actor counterpart.

**Terroristic divide and conquer**: A typical state terrorism method is *terroristic divide and conquer*. Since the state cannot exterminate 100% of individuals of the non-state actor counterpart, the method is based on identifying a subset of the population and using terror attacks (rape, torture, massacres, ecc...) against that subset, causing the remaining part to fall into terror and be more inclined to obedience.

**Indicators**: In order to operationalize the definition above, ten indicators are identified which, if satisfied, qualify a state as terroristic (namely, they establish state terrorism). The ten indicators are:

1. Indiscriminate attacks;
2. Torture;
3. Rape;
4. Inter-communitarian violence (having one state-protected community use violence against a community which is a subset of the non-state actor);
5. Externalization of terrorism (statal support of armed groups which are used for terror attacks against the non-state actor);
6. Guilt by association (it happens when a government punishes all the family members of a person which the government thinks is a criminal/terrorist);
7. Threat of genocide (clear-cut evidence of this is, for example, the threat of using weapons of mass destruction by members of the government);
8. Strategic use of hunger;
9. Infrastructural violence (also known as ""institutionalized violence"", it happens when the laws support the violence, including indirectly by non-condemnation);
10. De-responsibilizing rhetoric (which includes de-responsibilizing the state actor *and* may also include de-responsibilizing its state-allies).

The more indicators are met, the stronger becomes the evidence that the considered state actor is terroristic. If all ten indicators are met, then the state actor is classified as terroristic. It is important to observe that each of these indicators, *per se*, is nothing new, as they were independently identified by academical research decades (or even centuries) ago.

**Case Study: Israel**

To answer the question if Israel is a terroristic state, each indicator requires evidence. When all the evidence is accumulated, depending on how many indicators have been checked and how strong is the evidence, an evaluation can be made. Here is the indicator checklist:

1. **Indiscriminate attacks**: extremely strong evidence, also including cases prior to 7-Oct-2023, like [this one](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65812442);
2. **Torture**: extremely strong evidence from independent international sources, e.g. [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/06/israeli-police-targeted-palestinians-with-discriminatory-arrests-torture-and-unlawful-force/) (2021 article);
3. **Rape**: extremely strong evidence, e.g. [Sde Teiman detention camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sde_Teiman_detention_camp);
4. **Inter-communitarian violence**: One crucial example of this is when Israeli settlers, supported by IDF, which attacked Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, and later they were [sanctioned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68173904) by USA;
5. **Externalization of terrorism**: [Sabra and Shatila massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre) (1982);
6. **Guilt by association**: Family members of fighters from Hamas are attacked and treated as ""terrorists"" themselves, [imprisoned ](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/29/why-does-israel-have-so-many-palestinians-detention-and-available-swap)when captured alive;
7. **Threat of genocide**: Israel's far-right minister Amichai Eliyahu threatened multiple times the use of a nuclear bomb in Gaza ([source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-minister-renews-call-for-striking-gaza-with-nuclear-bomb-/3117351));
8. **Strategic use of hunger**: Gaza Strip famine, as confirmed by [United Nations](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/07/un-experts-declare-famine-has-spread-throughout-gaza-strip);
9. **Infrastructural violence**: None/few IDF war crimes (such as the cases of torture and rape of prisoners) have not been condemned by Israel tribunal, or the punishment were too weak;
10. **De-responsibilizing rhetoric**: [Hasbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_diplomacy_of_Israel), Zionism propaganda, and [Israel lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States) in the USA.

Thus, the evidence points to the conclusion that *yes, Israel is a case of State terrorism*.

**Is this just your opinion? No**. This is not just my personal conclusion/opinion: I have summarized (and simplified, since I didn't want to write a 10+ pages essay) the arguments of an academic researcher, [prof. Alessandro Orsini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Orsini_(sociologist)) (LUISS University, Italy), which reached this conclusion. In [this article](https://www.securityincontext.org/posts/why-we-need-to-talk-about-state-terrorism-by-israel-in-gaza), the same conclusion is reached by [prof. Richard Jackson](https://www.otago.ac.nz/ncpacs/staff/professor-richard-jackson) (University of Otago, New Zealand) and [prof. Mandy Turner](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/mandy.turner) (University of Manchester, UK).

**Conclusions**: According to the given definitions, the adopted methodologies, and the stated arguments, the conclusion is that: ***Yes, Israel is a terroristic state***.

**Final Remarks**: These are conclusions reached by academic researchers, experts in terrorism studies (not random Reddit users). I would like to recall that fact-based posts, providing supporting evidence, are much better than merely opinions (without evidence), and also that *ad hominem* attacks against the cited researchers (including accusations such as ""pro-Hamas"", ""paid by Iran"", etc.) are a [fallacy](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_hominem).

Another thing is they try to conjure up weird justifications for the Jews to go back to the land based on ancestry.  Based on my past posts, we all know that pre 48 Zionism was one of the most evil ideologies to ever exist so
I won’t harp too much on that point. 

My point is the fact that Israel doesn’t believe in a right of return for Arabs today. They make up weird excuses about how Palestinians may try to harm Israelis but we know that’s all gobbledygook. Of course, this conflict has changed a lot. Pre 48, and especially since 1918, Palestinians were the undisputed good guys. They were the ones fighting for equality for all, as opposed to claiming racial supremacy by dividing the area into two states. 

Since then, the situation has of course changed. It’s unfair to say that the average Israeli today is anywhere near as evil or a depraved monster as his ancestor who migrated. The pro Palestinian side does need to realize that (usually) we don’t punish the children for the father’s sins. So, it is harder to say that all Palestinians are the undisputed good guys today, given that some support expelling Jews when they were not the ones who commited the evils of things like migration and Irgun; their fathers/grandfathers were. 

That being said, I think that Israel’s denial of a right to return for Arabs really dampens the cause of Zionism. Because if two groups are native to the area, why only give right of return to one? The only real reason is anti Arab racism. Just tout your “20% Arab” statistic and hope people don’t see the racism of a right to return for one group of people.",The hypocrisy of anyone on either side who tries to justify the creation of Israel.,0.16,0,0,2024-02-10 20:51:09

That's it. It's not a blank check to do whatever the country wants. It's not a means of waving away Netanyahu's right-wing insanity or the Occupation. It doesn't mean letting extremism run rampant at the expense of a true Israeli-Palestinian peace. For most American Jews, we believe Israel should exist and defend itself, but it is not above hostile criticism. And trust me, no one is better or more insistent on critiquing itself to no end than Jewish people. 

I see this the same way Americans believe in the founding father's supposed democratic ideals while acknowledging we haven't lived up to them over the centuries, from killing Native Americans to slavery and Jim Crow. The only way to peace is to acknowledge past sins while finding ways to overcome them. So saying Israel's treatment of the Palestinians must be different, especially post-Gaza war, is important. But by making anti-zionism a core part of their agenda, the protesters are viewing the extremist perspective as the only version of zionism that existed ever, despite history showing otherwise. Hell the Jewish people that started post-WWII human rights groups were zionists, so the motives seem contradictory. I often struggle to understand why the protesters can't see that when, if they just discussed common concerns between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups, we'd be a much stronger alliance in the realm of bringing peace.

Even the men there are often just tagging along with their girlfriends, trying to get laid, or gay.

Take a look at the ridiculous scenes out of Columbia, NYU, UTAustin, Harvard, and the like where there are massive tents and ""interpretive dance"" sessions. Ask yourself if any of this would be happening if the colleges had been dominated by men. Even outside the college protests, females heavily outnumber males. Go on social media, especially TikTok, to see how skewed the gender ratio is for advocates of the so-called Palestinian cause.

Everyone seems ok with pointing out that it's disproportionately very young people involved in the movement, and talking about how all of Gen-Z are morons but no one is bringing up the imbalanced gender ratio. Why does it seem like no one is willing to point out this obvious reality? Afraid of being called sexist? 

I am not sexist or misogynistic but I think that our inability to recognize this trend is making it hard for us to confront the problem. A lot of it is, frankly, young girls doing what they've always done, which is try to garner attention in any way. And while many have become extremely concerned about the antisemitism on college campuses, the fact that it's mostly young women involved in this unrest should calm fears that there will be large-scale physical escalations.

So I would recommend that people take a step back, take a breath of fresh air, and recognize that what we're seeing is likely not going to amount to much.

Germans who risked their own families' safety, for a larger cause to protect Jews, are heroes, not Columbia University rioters.

They are looking for America to suffer for providing military equipment to the IDF, without thinking about what the larger picture may be in regards to supporting a war against terrorism. That truth doesn't fit their narrative. 

IF there was a cease fire, and the IDF left, do you think Hamas would stop violently raiding Israel? To all these protestors, what exactly is your grand plan? I would have more respect for people who want to join the Red Cross or Peace Corp to assist with aid and negotiations, but vandalizing Columbia University has nothing to do with the people of Gaza.

People talk about Palestinian self determination but they had self determination in Gaza after the 2005 Israeli disengagement, and they determined to elect a party (Hamas) that explicitly ran on armed fighting against Israel. At this time there was no blockade yet and no occupation in Gaza as the Jews had been forced to leave by the Israeli army. They held elections and Hamas won.

History is shown that self determination in Palestine leads to them determining to launch rockets at their neighbors and the first time a jihadist gets elected they stop holding further elections, but still people will act as if the future of a ""free and independent palestine"" is a functioning state even though history and all similar states point towards it being a jihadist state and autocracy.

This isn't unique to palestine either, the last legitimate election held in Egypt was won by the Muslim brotherhood candidate, a party considered terrorists even by moderate Arab moderate like Saudi Arabia, UAE and bahrain.

There are 22 countries in the arab league and none of them are functional democracies, pretty much all the functioning ones have either a king or strongman who violently supresses his opposition, but for some reason when westerners contemplate the future of a ""free and independant"" Palestine they imagine a functioning democratic state, why?

Israelis do it differently.  They might do pargiyot (baby chicken) but they often do turkey and chicken mixed together, with lamb fat on the top that drips down.

1. The calls for a ceasefire but then in the next breath calls for an “intifada” or “revolution”. How can people claim to be pro-peace and speak of ending the violence when they actively call for more? Also, maybe it’s just me but when I hear “there is only one solution” my mind goes to a very dark place in Jewish history. 

2. Calls for Jews to leave Israel or “go back where they came from”. This one is somewhat weird to me because Jews returning where we came from is exactly what Zionism is. There are a few conspiracy theories out there attempting to disprove Jewish connection to the land, but they all fail woefully to disprove the fact that Israel is the Jewish homeland. As long as people continue to see Israelis as foreigners, they’re never going to be able to fully grasp the conflict and understand why Israelis aren’t about to leave. All that lack of understanding will lead to is more violence and bloodshed. Also, if you genuinely believe that what the Palestinians experienced during the Nakba was wrong, then how can you advocate that the same sort of treatment be applied to Israelis? The solution to the conflict cannot involve Israelis being forced out of the only homes most of them have ever known.

3. How can people who are pro-Palestinian take an extremely idealistic stance about destroying Israel while people are actively dying? Maybe this one bothers me because I’m a pragmatist, but how can people have such an idealistic stance when that stance has been taken by Hamas, leading to the current fighting? Wouldn’t it be better to instead push for a middle ground? Yet that’s not what most pro-Palestinian protests seem to call for. 

4. Attempts to deny or justify October 7th. This is just disgusting to me. It is well documented by Hamas that they did what they are accused of. Yet people will put on blinders and deny what happened or attempt to justify it . In no way shape or form is what Hamas did even close to acceptable, yet people were out celebrating the attack on October 8th. I’m sorry but if you’re so callous that you can’t condemn the brutal killing, maiming, or hostage taking that Hamas participated in , you are part of the problem. And before anyone tries to turn this around to discuss the situation in Gaza, I will say that the situation there is awful and it’s terrible that people are dying the way they are.

The 40,000 casualties are likely only those who have been identified by name; the uncounted deaths, the countless bodies still lying under the rubble, are not included in this figure.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the casualty numbers, which have not been updated for many months, could be much higher. Looking at images of the immense destruction in Gaza supports my belief that the casualty figures are likely much higher.

The common counterarguments that these numbers are too high because Hamas is not a reliable source do not make sense to me.

Palestinians are not ethnically Arab, but they have been Arabized by the Arabs.

Let me explain further in detail:

Thousands of years ago there was an ethnic and religious group living in this land of Israel/Palestine who practiced Judaism as a religion. They were known as the Ashkenazi Jews and were native to the land of what is now Israel/Palestine. The main city of this region was called ""Jerusalem"" which was there for 6000 years. Jerusalem was conquered and invaded a lot in the 6000 years. The Romans in the birth of Christ conquered Jerusalem and then eventually banned Jews from living there, so many Jews ended up staying in Europe, but typically married other Jews. This explains why many Ashkenazi Jews say they are indigenous to the Levant because they have ties there. Adding on, if you go on the Illustrative DNA subreddit, you will find many Ashkenazi Jews having traces that go back to the Levant, showing results of having Canaanite DNA.

The ones remaining in the regions known as Israel/Palestine were Arabized which led to the majority of those living in that land following the religion of Islam. The land where these people lived eventually became known as Palestine and the people were called ""Palestinians"". This debunks the take that the Palestinians are ""Arab colonizers"", when in fact they have been colonized by the Arabs and are indigenous to the Levant as well.

To conclude, both Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians, have ties to the Levant, both having Canaanite DNA, and it's sad to see many people tell both groups where they believe these groups are from for propaganda purposes. If you need further explanation/proof look at the Illustrative DNA and type in ""Ashkenazi Jewish"", ""from Israel"", etc., or type ""Palestinian"" to see people that are from both groups having Canaanite DNA.

When I scroll through social media, I witness many creators from both sides spreading hateful messages. The most common ones I have witnessed are people on the pro-Palestine side saying that ""Jews should just go back to where they came from"" or ""Jews are from Poland or some Eastern European country"". The pro-Israeli side will mention how Palestinians are ""Arab colonizers that colonized the land"". No matter what one's stance on this war, this hateful speech is extremely ignorant and should be criticized. Telling someone that where they are from is not actually where they are from to prove their stance on this war is not promoting peace in any way.


Edit: I want to make one thing clear. I am neither Jewish nor Palestinian. I am just tired of this hatred against groups of people. If you ask me what side I am on, I am pro-peace. I do criticize Israel and the ongoing displacement and suffering of the Palestinian people and criticize Hamas for taking hostages and acts of terrorism. Some comments in response to some of you guys are opinion-based, based on what I have studied or believed to be the case regarding this situation. Regardless, I hope both the state of Israel and the Palestinian state are recognized and wish for peace in the end.  

Edit 2: Like I told another commenter, I apologize if this post makes it seem like I am dismissing Mizrahi Jews. I am aware that Mizrahi Jews are the largest demographic of Jews in Israel. I am also aware that there are other ethnic Jews other than Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews. I specifically wanted to point out Ashkenazi Jews for this post as most of this hatred is directed towards them. For the Mizrahi Jews and the other ethnic Jews in Israel, many pro-Palestinians will talk about how they should go back to Morocco, Yemen, Ethiopia, etc. disregarding the fact if these communities ""go back to their country"" then they would be persecuted for being Jewish.",I am tired of seeing people on social media spread hateful messages about Jews and Palestinians,0.84,109,0,2024-06-06 17:02:25

Since a round of stories a month ago announcing the safe zone’s existence, I have seen extremely little from news sources or on Twitter about how many people are living there, how safe they are, how successfully aid groups have been able to care for people staying there, whether there is a prospect for aid deliveries by sea, how and if the Israelis have prevented Hamas and other groups from bringing rockets and arms there, or whether there are prospects for the safe zone's expansion (i.e., more territory, more housing, more humanitarian infrastructure, and capacity to keep more people safe).

If the Israelis ultimately have not been able to keep armed groups out of Muwasi, I wonder if there is any prospect for creating a safe zone immediately outside Gaza, on Israeli territory, where it might be much easier to keep weapons out (and accordingly guarantee no bombing and no fighting) and bring aid and medical care in. The humanitarian case for doing so hardly needs to be explained. And with fewer civilians in areas like Khan Yunis for Hamas to 'hide behind' (in Israeli terms) if more civilians chose to move into safe zones outside Hamas control, Hamas would presumably be weakened.

I know that politicians on the right are pushing for civilians to leave Gaza altogether, and I hope it is clear that my suggestion is not that. A safe zone that is adjacent to and contiguous with Gaza, and is carved out of Israeli land, is not a formula for ‘depopulating Gaza’. It’s a suggestion for how to keep people safe and alive, recognizing that most people in Gaza are very unsafe, and are already living outside their homes, many of which are no longer even standing.

Prologue 

If anything bad comes, it comes from me, if its good, it is from god. 

In a messed up world where everyone is quick to judge and slow to understand. Saudi Arabia as a nation stands in an extremely shrouded misconceptions and misconstrued narratives that are not made within its borders. Expectations and judgements that conflicts with each other. Geopolitical unfairness and more societal complexities that are intentionally disregarded for clout reasons. This will not be a good read for those who already choose to live their lives in an ignorant hateful approach for people and monarchs of which they have never even met realistically.


Main points 

• Misrepresentation in Media:

Since 1960s, The western propaganda machine has been loading its heaviest guns against Saudi Arabia. 1/20 times where the kingdom is represented in a good light, and that is only when a financial deal or public approval for a certain bill needs to be passed. There has been an emphasis on – extremism – oppression, and wealth. This is not fair while overlooking the reality of western countries destroying practically all arab countries with their “democracy ✨” and overlooking complexity and diversity of saudis in general. 
                   -religion - tribal system- moral system- family importance, etc… 

—Yemen war: The Yemen war is massively false reported in western media like insanity. Its depicted like “MBS suddenly woke up and chose to bomb all yemen for no reason”. Saudi never intervened in yemen until their “rightful” “democratic” president [plead](https://durham-repository.worktribe.com/OutputFile/1334388) to saudi and the Arabic league for intervention due to iran actions with houthis. 

— Saudia did not lose the war, not in the slightest, sure, objectively lost. Not militarly. Saudi has withdrawn from yemen because they understood the game iran is playing. Its the same they shoved Hamas to do in israel, prolonged war with media war. 


— فلسطين، and the american military base called israel in relation to Saudi Arabia: 

It is puzzling to me how people genuinely believe that Saudi Arabia was just gonna quick sell Palestinians and erase the case that one of our [kings died for](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110033405/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VbsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2EYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6896,4366537), and just forget they existed for a trading route and intel contract? Saudi has aramco, it will go broke after 200 or 300 years of lavishly spending. Use your mind when approaching this.

People are quick to jump to accusations while disregarding the reasoning of Saudi decision making. Saudi are not siding with iran not because they are shia. Saudi sunni may believe shia are not muslim or whatever, but the reason is apparent. Look at Iraq, Syria, yemen, salman al ouda, qutb, Lebanon and southern turkey.  Saudi is not siding with a monster criminal state against another monster criminal state. Iran is killing more muslims than israel.

 This does not mean Saudia will just ignore both, ( although it can, no one cares when saudi gets attacked or damaged) MBS holds gatherings, pressures decision makers and gives a podium for people to demonstrate their country needs. Its just you cant help someone who sold you for your enemy. 

This highlights the extreme complexity of political playground that people make reality of without understanding it. Just feeding their brains of the headlines

** indian BJP OR PJB OR something visit to medina ** good muslim wannabes often are head on to critique the kingdom for either authority dopamine or good preacher dopamine. Any how, this shows the lack of understanding of alot of muslims, medina and the masjid al nabawi are not prohibited to enter for non-muslims by islam.

• UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS: 
I have lived long enough to see people accuse saudi arabia for being uncivilised, radical, behind and uneducated. Those same people today are on twitter, on this subreddit and r/geopolitics are calling Saudis servants of israel, zionists and America. Or the Saudis are destroying islam. Saudis can genuinely use the “Antisemitism” card more than jews because its almost deplorable how much you do you are still the boogie man. 

The topic of israel, saudi and iran is not for the simple minded. Geopolitics is much more complicated than forming an opinion from youtube videos or your atheist uncle who lives in oregon and curses Saudi Arabia on twitter. Saudi leadership has decided to make peace with everyone in the region to fix the mess the west has caused, saudi CAN NOT go with their vision for 2030 without making massive amendments in the region. So kindly, educate yourself before yapping. 

Reform being in all aspects in saudi highlighted that if you do or you dont you will be hated anyway, so do it without care. 

Epilogue (TL:DR):- 

I am genuinely calling for everyone in the region to be open for a fair, nuanced, open balanced dialogue regarding the Kingdom. Challenging the perceived automatic biases in the west and understanding the geopolitical mess our region is in at the moment. Tackling the expectations of reforms and international diplomacy at the same time. There is so much intricacy in the region and its our responsibility to deal with it in the years to come.

Thanks

2) It’s not Israel’s problem that an absurd birth rate exploded Gaza’s population from 400,000 to 2 million over the past fifty years.  That said, land swaps to expand Gaza in exchange for Israel annexing the settlement blocs in the West Bank should absolutely be considered.  But it’s an “and,” not an “or.” The possibility of land swaps doesn’t preclude voluntary migration.  As for Israel “facilitating better living conditions,” it doesn’t rule Gaza and it’s not to blame for Hamas diverting foreign aid into weapons and tunnels.

3) You’re arguing a strawman.  Israel has no interest in Jewish settlements in Gaza - it ethnically cleansed all Jews from Gaza almost 20 years ago.

We all saw the early protests regarding this war, where people were happy and cheering the deaths of individuals who weren't even part of the IDF or the Israeli government. So, it appears that the deaths of innocent people may not be a significant concern for some, unless it fits their agenda.  
  
I know that the pain and destruction are difficult to watch, and it makes me wonder if there's a better way to move forward. However, I don't think people truly understand Hamas's objectives.

Their goal is to destroy the state of Israel, while Israel's goal is to destroy Hamas to prevent a repetition of the October 7th attack.  
  
What does Israel possibly gain from a ceasefire? They are the superior military power and are unlikely to have more casualties than Hamas. They might see no reason to end the war. For those who are calling for a ceasefire, what happens next? Hamas is responsible for its people, and if they wanted this to end, they could surrender and give up.

But do you think that's going to happen? Do you think Hamas is going to try to create a better future for their people by not being a terror state and actually trying make a decent place to live.

Please don't take any opinions as an insult to your ethnicity but I would instead appreciate it if you explain to me why I'm wrong in any particular way.... I'm not from either communities so my opinion is 100% unbiased. 

Prior to 1947, there were times when both Jews and Arabs lived on the Levant (sticking to this name to avoid hateful confrontations). The Jews occupied the Levant first but the Arabs had inhabited the Levant for a much longer period of time. Jews hadn't lived in Levant for ages as they were forced off their land by different parties all throughout history. When WW2 was over, the Jews returned to the land they thought was theirs but it's been colonized by arabs for a long time. 

Coming to post 1947, the UN has decided to partition the Levant into Israel and Palestine. Palestine is reluctant to accept this offer as they believe the land belongs entirely to them. As a result of this and many civil fights, Palestine wages war on Israel with a coalition of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Miraculously, Israel emerged victorious and captured areas of Palestine and the coalition. In an attempt to regain the land, another war was waged on Israel (6-day war) and this ended up failing too with the outcome of Israel gaining even more land. I believe this happened a third time but there were no significant changes in regards to ownership of land. A few years after the third war, Israel decides to give the land back to the members of the coalition to maintain peace in the region. Israel also decides to give Gaza and West Bank back to Palestine however, there were Jews that had already settled in the West Bank by this time. Is this why Palestine feels like it has Jewish settler problems in the west bank today and the Hamas October 7th attacks were justified for this reason?

Update to original question :

It doesn't look like I'll get an unbiased opinion and that's totally understandable. I would behave the same way if my people had to face similar issues faced by both Jews and Palestinians. 
But my ultimate question is what are both parties expecting as an outcome of their involvement in this war? Like what do Israelis want and what does Hamas aim to achieve after this war? ",Help me understand,0.75,12,0,2024-01-02 11:19:15

*""I'm fighting to be good,"" she tells me. ""I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain. I'm fighting to be the same person I was before.""*  
  
*Yael heads a charity called Road to Recovery, a group of Israeli volunteers who drive sick Palestinians - mostly children - from checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza to hospital appointments in Israel.*  
  
*Or did.*  
  
*The 1,000 or so volunteers can no longer take patients from Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. And four of them are dead - murdered as Palestinian gunmen stormed through their kibbutzim in southern Israel.*  
  
*They include Vivian Silver, a renowned peace activist; Adi Dagan, who Yael describes as ""funny"" and always ready to step in and ferry patients at short notice in his big car; Tammy Suchman, a much-loved grandmother; and Eli Or-Gad, who loved talking about poetry.*  
  
*Four other volunteers lost close family members on 7 October.*  
  
*About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 17,177 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which followed.*

*Two of her nephews have been fighting in Gaza, in Israel's military response.*

*In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, Yael says she was so shaken that she could barely breathe.*  
  
*""Something was broken in my heart and I said that I would never talk to people in Gaza again,"" she tells me.*  
  
*But after a few days, she decided that she couldn't allow the atrocities to change her.*  
  
*She and most of the Road to Recovery volunteers have continued to drive Palestinians from the West Bank to hospitals in Israel for cancer treatment, organ transplants and kidney dialysis. As soon as she can, she says she'll go and collect patients from Gaza again.*

*Yael refuses to dehumanise them, or equate them with Hamas, which is classed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.*  
  
*""Like us they are victims of Hamas, so I think we should keep on helping them, because it's not their fault,"" she tells me over the phone.*  
  
*""We can't refuse to help a child with cancer. Our neighbours need help, so we need to help them.""*  
  
*She worries for the families she knows in Gaza, with winter approaching and so many bombed houses now uninhabitable.*  
  
*The parent of a 6-year-old child, who'd had an organ transplant, texted one of the Road to Recovery volunteers saying simply: ""We are okay. We are going to die here.""*

*Yael is also desperately concerned for two Road to Recovery volunteers, Oded Lifschitz and Chaim Peri, who are still being held hostage by Hamas.*  
  
*Emotionally, she feels like she's being torn apart. She has uncles and cousins who are adamantly opposed to what she's doing and accuse her of helping Hamas.*  
  
*And it's not just family members who disapprove.*  
  
*""When I'm driving with Palestinians through checkpoints in the West Bank, soldiers have asked me how I can do what I'm doing,"" she tells me. ""Other people ask the same question.""*  
  
*""It's dangerous now to even talk about the suffering of the kids in Gaza - people look at me like I'm the enemy,"" she says, through sobs. ""But I'm not doing it for the Palestinians, I'm doing it because I want to be proud to be Israeli. I believe that whether you're an Israeli or a Palestinian, a Jew or an Arab, people are people.""*  
  
*Some Palestinian families have reached out to find out how she is. But it's harder than ever now for those few people swimming against the tide by trying to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians.*  
  
*""Even people on the left say that we should flatten Gaza. Both sides have become more and more radicalised,"" Yael says.*  
  
*""I really don't know what will happen in the future. But I know that both of us will still live here, so we must find a solution.""*  
  
*Since 7 October, some Road to Recovery volunteers have dropped out of driving altogether or decided to focus on taking medicines to displaced Israelis instead, while the war lasts.*  
  
*But other volunteers have stepped in, to make sure that sick Palestinians from the West Bank still get to appointments that are saving their lives.*  
  
*Yael says the charity will need support from the outside world to keep going because donations from within Israel have virtually stopped.*  
  
*But she is sure that, when it becomes possible, Road to Recovery will be collecting child patients from Gaza again - hoping that they will all have survived.*  
  
*""It may be hard. But we can't stop,"" she says. ""It's my mission and I have to do it.""*

on the Palestinian side there are radicals who do not want to admit that partition is necessary, because of them the Palestinians missed the UN partition in 1948; this tiny minority is always hostile to any peace process

on the Israeli side there are politicians who don't care about the hostages and IDF soldiers killed, injured and disabled for life, and even less care about the thousands of Palestinians killed, they have locked up, through lies, certain Israelis in a vicious circle, a fallacious logic of inevitable war.In fact, these people have ideological obsessions  that they put before human life,

there is also the American military-industrial complex which likes to see wars around the world...

after seven months of war  any observer with a minimum of intelligence surely understood that Hamas has the means to resist for a long time in Gaza, several years according to the most reliable analyzes ; in addition Hamas, and other resistance groups, have thousands of fighters outside Gaza, well armed and trained, and supported by regional powers

in summary, the Palestinian resistance will never stop and on the other side, the Jews are convinced of their right to their historic lands from which they were expelled (by the Romans and not by the Arabs)

I don’t like using these to paint Israelis as all racist since I have an Arab Israeli friend from Canada that wants peace between Palestinians and Israelis. 

Granted with people who hate Israel and support Hamas they have videos of the hostages smiling and waving and the revised Hamas charter that says their struggle is with Zionists and not Jews to humanize Hamas even though it’s BS and it seems like Israel is losing its pr and Hamas is doing a better job at times at pretending to be less evil than they are with the things above I mentioned. As a progressive it’s just sad and frustrating to see this type of stuff and with these people in the Israeli government it’s hard to feel frustrated and feel that none of this helps Israel’s image and makes it harder to get to peace.

However, how common is this view among Israelis? I'm not Christian, I'm Muslim. However, I'm curious about Israelis' attitudes towards Christians. 

In terms of foreign policy, Israel seems to support mostly-Muslim Azerbaijan against the mostly-Christian Armenia. I don't understand this. Why does Israel hate Armenia and support Turkey and Azerbaijan?

I also know Maimonides, Baruch Erfati, and Tovia Singer have all supported Islam over Christianity, and I know Baruch Erfati wants Christianity abolished worldwide but not necessarily Islam. With this in mind, why are they all Zionists, as the Zionists are often just tools of the Christians? 

As a Muslim, Zionism deeply offends me. For at least many centuries, Palestine was majority Muslim. In Islam, when a land is majority Muslim, it a sinful to let it ever become minority Muslim. However, the Christians have no such view. The Christians have all sorts of weird religious beliefs and are often Zionists for a wide range of reasons. 

Is the relationship between Christianity and Zionism new? The Zionists seem to have a complicated view of Christianity. Lots of the Israeli Zionists, the Jewish Zionists, seem to want the Christians to be taunted and degraded a lot. However, outside of Israel, i.e. occupied-Palestine, the Zionists seem to include Jews and Christians and others in many multifaith organizations. I find this dynamic confusing. 

Do the Israelis simply hate Christianity but like Christians? Why would someone like Christians but hate Christianity?

Israel has no beef with Palestinians. The beef is with Hamas. And Hamas has put them between a rock and a hard place. Either continue dying at the hands of terrorists, or destroy them at the risk of killing the people Hamas is hiding behind. It's kill or be killed. Palestinian deaths are not the fault of Israel but of Hamas. Civilians are being kept there by force to shield them. Hamas is the pack of wolves, and the Palestinians are the sheep's clothing they put on. 

What really gets me here in the US is that the same people calling conservatives Nazis are calling for Jew genocide. I don't get it.

We all need to remember who the terrorists are here and who the victims are. Israelis are victims. Palestinians are victims. Hamas is the big bad wolf. Hamas has forces Israel's hand to war, and war is always, always messy for everyone involved. And now we've got the world on Israel's back to end this.... They're trying. Hamas started this, and they aren't letting up. If hamas would disband today and forever more, Palestinians would be safe from Israel for all time. Israel doesn't want this conflict. They don't want to rule Palestine, kill civilians, or (most of all) be killed. They're the good guys. We'd do well to remember this.

It makes sense, but if it were just for this reason it wouldn't have to be in Israel. There are several countries with large uninhabited areas that Jews could try to acquire.

Others emphasize the legality of the establishment, such as the purchase of lands, the consent of immigration by the Ottoman and British governments, the UN partition plan, and the recognition of Israel by the vast majority of countries. This is correct but it doesn't really provide a moral justification. By itself, it sounds like colonization.

Some people try to justify the situation in practice, saying that Israel has already been there for several decades and is pretty developed, so it would be impractical or detrimental to reverse it now. This argument doesn't provide a moral justification either. Even some Arabs agree with this argument, but it's like accepting defeat, and they still think that the situation is wrong.

Others try to justify it saying that most ancestors of today's Jews lived in that land for centuries. This is true but the same can be said of many ethnic groups that also experienced historical mass migration. The location of ancestors by itself is not a sufficient connection, especially if so many generations have passed since the migration occurred and the culture has changed.

Some people appeal to religion, saying that God promised the land to Jews. But this argument has no weight for people who don't believe in the Bible or who believe that the promise has expired.

I propose a different argument, which combines the previous two with an important addition: Jews have kept a very strong attachment to the land during their entire period in the diaspora. It's not just that their ancestors were from there. For all these generations, Jews kept reading and teaching to their children the biblical stories, the vast majority of which take place in the land of Israel or are about returning there. They recorded and studied detailed discussions on how to keep certain religious practices that can only be done in that land. They kept their language that originated there and enriched it with more words and literature. They kept celebrating holidays and observing fasts that commemorate events that happened there. The prayers that Jews say every day are filled with longing and asking for their return to the land. They wrote poetry and songs about the land, which they still sing often. In sum, both the religion and the culture that Jews maintained during this whole time, even among those who were not religious, always had an essential component of remembering and hoping to return to the land someday.

In addition, Jews actually tried several times to regain their independence in the land of Israel. Contrary to a popular misconception, the Roman Empire didn't expel all Jews from the whole land, only from Jerusalem. Jews did two more revolts against the Roman Empire, failed, but remained the majority of the population there until the middle of the Byzantine period. At that time they joined the Samaritans and revolted again, and this time, after many more Jews were killed or fled, they finally became a minority. Still, later they allied with the Sassanid Empire and did another revolt against the Byzantine Empire, even started rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem, until this rebellion was also repressed and reduced the Jewish population even more.

This was the situation when Muslims conquered the land. With successive Muslim empires, interrupted by the Crusades, Jews were too few, dispersed and persecuted to even consider trying to regain control. But they still kept their strong attachment to the land and praying for their return, as I described above. An interesting episode attesting this sentiment occurred during the Ottoman Empire. A Jew claimed to be the Messiah, called Jews to return to Israel, and gathered enormous interest from Jews everywhere, many of whom started preparing to move. Even Christians were excited about it. Eventually he was imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities, forced to convert to Islam, and the movement faded, but it showed that the strong interest clearly existed.

Finally, when the Ottoman Empire started adopting democratic policies in the 19th century, Jews immediately noticed the favorable conditions and started returning in large numbers. The city of Jerusalem already had a Jewish majority by 1860, decades before the word Zionism was even invented. Later when the British Empire took control and was friendly to Jews, they saw the opportunity that they had long hoped and prayed for. They started migrating in even larger numbers and in a few decades established an impressive infrastructure for the new country.

In sum, Jews always had a strong religious, emotional and cultural attachment to the land, and tried many times to regain control of it whenever they saw a possibility. It just took a very long time until the situation was favorable enough for it to happen. And I believe that this reason is what morally justifies the establishment of the Jewish state there. Even if you don't believe in the Jewish religion, it's undeniable that Jews identified themselves with that land the whole time, even when few were physically there. To dismiss this connection as a historical detail with no practical relevance would be ignorant and disrespectful to the culture that Jews created and maintained for their entire existence.",The justification for the establishment of Israel is Jews' continued attachment to the land during the diaspora,0.73,30,0,2025-02-03 08:50:21

33 hostages captured on Oct. 7 will be released back into Israel, while Israel will withdraw from many populated areas of the Gaza Strip and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Many nations have welcomed the deal while others in the Middle East state that a ceasefire is not enough considering all the destruction this war has brought to the region. 

The goal of this deal is to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 46,500 people. Cities in Gaza have been leveled by Israeli airstrikes. Many Palestinians have been seen celebrating this event as Hamas being the victor of the war. Meanwhile, many in the Israeli government do not support this deal as they claim Hamas has the advantage in the deal.

Aside from this, many international organizations have called the current Gaza conflict an “genocide”. This is mainly attributed to the IDF’s attacks and sieges of key Gaza infrastructure such as schools, refugee camps, and hospitals.

5. One person: ""There is no solution."" And when asked if he wants a solution and to live in peace: ""No. Because there is no solution. This land can only have one."" And when asked if he believes that the two peoples can live together: ""No.""
6. One person: ""That we return to our home (in what is today Israel), to be able to access all our land, and that there not be peace between -"" and was interrupted to clarify if there would be peace, she said ""No."" And when asked why: ""Because we asked for peace and we are not seeing peace. Everything is violent, there is killing and violence.""
7. One person: ""I believe that if we were under a unified authority where our authority would organize protests, then we would have been liberated long ago."" When asked to describe what that liberation should look like: ""One state."" And when asked if the Israelis will live with Palestinians: ""No. After what happened in Gaza and the martyrs here in Palestine, I don't think we can.""
8. One person: ""Resistance. To take care of ourselves. There is nothing better than resisting. . . . At the end of the day, this is our land. We either live or we accept what will happen."" And when asked about a 2SS: ""No. This is our land. Before they came here, this was our land. All of Palestine. We are originally refugees here. There isn't a separation between these lands.""

Notably, the Irish managed to free themselves of the British and are now among Palestine's most ferverent allies.

However, Israel is not the UK and the approaches the Palestinian liberation movements have taken so far, which emulate past anticolonial struggles, fundamentally won't work against it.

Ultimately the UK left Ireland not because they were dealt a total military defeat, but because holding on to the territory was made so expensive, both militarily and politically, that the occupation became untenable. This was only possible, because the UK didn't fundamentally need to hold Ireland. It might have been lucrative or prestigious, but it was not necessary. And this is why the UK could be convinced to cut their losses and go home.

For Israel the situation is very different. There is no home island they might 'go home' to. To have control over its own territory is a fundamental and necessary part of its statehood. No amount of terror attacks or expense caused by resistance fighting will make it untenable for Israel to continue its fight for existence. Unlike the British, Israel is willing to absorb infinite expense, because they are not fighting for land, that they can ultimately give away, but fundamentally their own existence as a state.

I left a year ago, just before the war began, knowing it was coming and would be bloody. Israel’s internal state—socially, economically, and politically—was already dire.

It felt impossible to live there. The cost of living soared, the government was corrupt, pushing undemocratic laws, and religious populations were growing much faster than secular ones. Distrust was rampant, with people trying to take advantage of each other, even close friends and family. It was like a pyramid, where everyone trampled those below, and at the bottom were the Palestinians. As Israeli society crumbled, it became clear the Palestinians would seize the moment, sparking violence and an inevitable harsh response from Israel.

I left because I couldn’t be part of this. I don’t believe in the concept of countries, especially when I feel exploited by a corrupt government uninterested in peace, treating its citizens like cash cows under the guise of ""security.""

I also felt betrayed by the people, though it was hard to pinpoint why. Living in Israel, you're conditioned to believe you’re the victim, that everyone is out to kill you, and that Jews must stick together. But in reality, Jews don’t support each other—many would gladly stab you in the back.

These are harsh words, but this is my view, shaped by my experiences. I come from a broken family with an abusive father and struggled to find love and trust. Putting my personal experiences aside, it’s clear now that Israel has become utterly corrupt and violent. It boils down to the fact that Israel is not a democracy.

We can debate whether Israel is committing genocide, if Gaza can be compared to the Holocaust, or whether Israel is an apartheid state. But we cannot deny that Israel is not a democracy—half its population lacks basic human rights, including the right to vote. Allowing them to vote would threaten Israel’s identity as a Jewish state.

Why doesn’t anyone talk about this? Israel never intended to occupy Palestinian territories. After the 1967 war, it held onto the land for strategic reasons. When peace talks nearly succeeded in 1997, they crumbled, leading to a wave of terrorism and the complete collapse of trust in the peace process. That set the stage for religious nationalists like Netanyahu to take over, with no interest in preserving democracy. His alliance with the religious far-right, who openly oppose democracy, has been in power ever since.

In short, Israel oppresses half its population and is ruled by a religious-nationalist regime that’s openly anti-democratic. So if democracy is just a façade, what is Israel really? To me, it’s a fanatical religious state, rooted in the belief that God promised this land to the Jews—a belief that drives the oppression of Palestinians.

This view contrasts sharply with how Israel perceives itself. Israel wasn’t always like this. It once functioned as a modern state striving for peace. When I was 10 in the 1990s, people believed that by the time I turned 18, there would be peace, and I wouldn’t have to serve in the army.

But the fundamental mistake was the Jewish return to Israel. It was Hitler’s greatest victory—he succeeded in removing Jews from Europe, and instead of realizing the harm religion had caused, Jews clung to it even more. Zionists, though not initially religious, used religion to unite Jews, which worked—but at a cost. The Bible gave religious factions the right to demand its laws be enforced, and now they are the majority in Israel.

Jewish tradition evolved over 2,000 years as a minority, often self-segregating and exploiting their non-Jewish neighbors. Those who assimilated lost their Jewish identity, leaving the most extreme behind. That’s what we see in Israel now: the religious isolating themselves, avoiding military service, living off government subsidies, and not contributing to the economy—essentially scamming the rest of the country, just as Jews were accused of doing in Europe.

So what’s next for Israel? How can a country survive, surrounded by enemies and consumed from within by religious fanatics? People like me, modern and secular, are fleeing. We are the ones who pay taxes, innovate, and serve in the army. When we leave, all that remains is a militant regime in constant conflict with equally militant enemies. The line between Israelis and Palestinians has blurred—they are almost the same now. The only difference is that Israel is propped up by the U.S., which sees it as a frontline defense.

I want no part of this madness. I believe the land should be returned to the Palestinians, and the Jews—especially those of European descent—should return to where they came from. After all, those from Arab countries can stay, as they are essentially Arabs themselves. It’s harsh, but the fact is, the Arab Jews are the most fanatical supporters of Netanyahu and the war. So as far as concern - Let them fight each other until they're all gone. Isn’t it what natural selection is all about?

They have both expressed their own stance as being supportive of Israel.

Trump has a history of being one of the most actively pro-zionist presidents. His administrations policy directly effected the situation in the Middle East, especially in light of the ""Abraham Accords"" between Israel and other nations.

Harris has a history of being strongly aligned with pro-palestinian politicians and has very much been a do-nothing vice-president. Trump claims she hates Israel and that her election as president would lead to Israel's destruction. However, during this short campaign of hers and in the debate tonight she has flipped to a passionately pro-Israel stance. She even pushed hard on the ~~questionable~~ rape accusation on Oct 7.

Not holding these groups accountable builds resentment and fuels a cycle of anger and retaliation, creating even more tension and mistrust in the region.

We'll probably be talking about the merits of the case for a while, but I'd just like to add my 2 cents as to how I think it'll affect the various parties in the conflict, with the information we have right now.

# The US

The US has been pretty hostile to the ICC, especially since they threatened to investigate Americans for war crimes in Afghanistan. Eventually, the ICC caved in, and decided to exclusively investigate the enemies of the US, not its allies. This puts them back on the war path. Especially since, [according to US Senator Lindsey Graham](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1792535545249165506), the ICC went behind their back, and went back on their promises to the US.

That also means the US has gained a powerful lever against Israel, to force them into their vision of a regional peace plan. Something that Biden clearly wants, Netanyahu and his far-right coalition clearly don't, and the Opposition being kinda coy about. I feel this could be the last straw, that would make Israel give in and align with the American plan. If not with this government, then with the next.

# Israel and Israelis

Netanyahu, and everyone to the right of Netanyahu are obviously freaking out and lashing out. But it's important to note that even hardcore anti-Netanyahu centrists and moderate leftists, such as Yair Lapid or publicist Anshel Pfeffer, view this as an outrageous decision by the ICC. However you hate Netanyahu, it's hard to see this as anything but an indictment of Israel, its war with Hamas, its capability to defend itself in the future, as well as its independent judiciary. Even Israelis who disagree with how the war was prosecuted, seeing Gallant and Netanyahu mentioned in the same breath with Sinwar and Deif, and Israel's war against Hamas mentioned in the same breath as Oct. 7th, is beyond appalling.

People who expect a future anti-Netanyahu administration, or the mainstream Israeli public to gloat, or even cooperate with the ICC are going to be sorely disappointed. Israel will probably fight this, even after Netanyahu is gone. This includes people who want Netanyahu in Israeli prison, for his corruption.

# Israel's judiciary system

The aforementioned ""independent judiciary"" is a big problem, for the liberal Israelis. The ones who went out in droves in the streets, to defend it from a government power grab, just before Oct. 7th. One of the biggest, often-repeated arguments for a strong independent judiciary, was that it would be a ""bulletproof vest for Hague"". The ICC intending to indict the Israeli leadership anyway, shows that it's not that ""bulletproof"" at all. It shows to the Israelis that the international community doesn't particularly care whether the Israeli courts are independent - they're still treated as the courts of various failed states and dictatorships, from Sudan to Russia. It's a slap in their face, and a boon to their powerful enemies. I don't think that saying ""but they threatened to do this to the US too, and backed down"" will be enough of a counter-argument. And that's *before* the circus of the upcoming Commission of Inquiry, that would expose them to even further attacks from all sides. I think the Israeli judiciary, from the AG to the High Court of Justice, is the primary loser here.

# The Palestinian Authority

Ultimately, the ICC's decision happened because of the PA, and their request for them to open an investigation in ""their"" territory (even though they didn't control Gaza, even back then). With this, they've hurt their two main rivals, Hamas and Israel, without much effort, a major victory. However, I'm not sure they'll survive this victory. The Israeli government is currently discussing dismantling the PA altogether, or at least severely punishing it for the ICC warrants. The PA is currently viewed as the reasonable alternative to Hamas by the US and the international community, and as Hamas-lite by the Israeli government. The outrage over the warrants dovetails nicely with the campaign to prevent the possibility of creating a ""Fatahstan"" in Gaza. So far, they seem to be the biggest winners, but they could also end up being the biggest losers.

# The ICC

The ICC, so far, has been an expensive failure. In its 22 years of existence, and around 100 million Euros per year, it issued 10 convictions and 4 acquittals, all for warlords from failed third-world states. This case, along with their attempts in Afghanistan, and their warrants against Putin, seem to mark a change in direction. Focusing less on people they could actually reasonably prosecute, and more on trying to gain influence and respect by issuing aspirational warrants, against leaders of nuclear states.

Now, this gambit could ultimately break them, if they piss off the US and EU enough. But I'm not sure it actually undermines their authority and respectability, as some people are saying. Since honestly, they didn't have a lot of either before. Becoming something more symbolic and political, instead of chasing warlords from the poorest countries in the world and failing, could ultimately bolster the little power they wield.

I'm also not sure that it shows an antisemitic malice towards Israel, as some already claim. I feel it's more of the [ICTY tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia), of divvying up guilt between all the parties in the war, overriding the old Nuremberg formula of only charging the aggressor (and conveniently, the loser). But then again, I can't deny that it also relies on the standard, rather obnoxious Western narrative about Israel, as a country that's allowed to survive, but not win wars.

# Pro-Palestinians

Finally, I wonder how it'll affect the people who should be the most ecstatic about these warrants, the pro-Palestinians, both in the West and the Muslim world. Yes, the hated Zionist entity is finally charged with the war crimes and crimes against humanity they always claimed. But Hamas are charged with even worse crimes, including rape. If we were talking about this 5 years ago, I'd say it's a pure cause for celebration for the pro-Palestinians. Before Oct. 7, they never had a problem throwing Hamas under the bus, and making false equivalencies between their horrific ideology and Israel's. But since Oct. 7, the pro-Palestinians around the world have been in an intense Purity Spiral, and possibly a directed campaign to legitimize and even glorify Hamas. Admitting that the Oct. 7 *was* every bit as bad as the Israelis said, and was a Crime Against Humanity and not a Glorious Act of Resistance, might be a little too much to swallow, just to call Netanyahu a war criminal with more authority. Going against the ICC decision on Hamas, while celebrating their decision for Israel, seems a bit much - the Israeli right-wing isn't celebrating the indictment of Hamas leadership either.

So overall, this is a bittersweet moment, possibly even a downright bitter moment for them. We'll see if they end up turning on Hamas, or turning on the ICC, or whether it'll split the movement even further.

On a state level, Turkey and Qatar are currently hosting Haniyeh, and actively supporting Hamas and their propaganda. Neither of them are ICC members (ed: thanks [MayJare](https://www.reddit.com/user/MayJare/)), but hosting and supporting Hamas is already kind of a bad look, for strategic US allies. Harboring a criminal, wanted for crimes against humanity, including extermination and rape, is even worse - and being able to dunk on Netanyahu a little more isn't a good tradeoff. Will they celebrate the warrants anyway? Will Qatari Al Jazeera be pro-ICC or anti-ICC after that? Unclear, but interesting to follow.

It seems that lately, anyone who defends Israel is expected to be repeatedly and explicitly vocal about distinguishing between the terrorists and the innocent civilian population of Gaza, like children. Which we absolutely should. But Pro-Palestinians do not hold themselves up to the same standard. They frequently fail to denigrate the terrorists while defending the people of Gaza. They especially fail to disparage those Palestinians who Sympathize with Hamas, and Hate Israel.

P-Ps also act like there's more little children in Gaza than anywhere else in the world, While 66% of Gazans are 13+.

The Gaza population is not like the average civilian population. 57% of the adult people in Gaza think that what Hamas did on 10/7 was the 'correct' thing to do. And only 10% think Hamas committed war crimes on 10/7. They're asking me to feel sorry for those people that think that way, also?

If a group of white supremacists stormed Chicago with the intent of killing all of the black people on the west side, and this group brought their cheerleaders along with them. And these cheerleaders waved their pompoms in the air and did their cheerleading routine to the tune of Taylor Swift's ""Bad blood"", cheering on their white supremacist brothers and husbands as they shot unarmed black people to death. But then, the black people started fighting back and killed the white supremacists off one by one, and their cheerleaders got caught in the crossfire and most of them were killed. Well, these cheerleaders didn't actually shoot anyone, but should we feel sorry for them?

Pro-Palestinians are asking me, and everyone else, to feel sorry for those 57% terrorist supporting thugs, too. For people with such poverty of heart and humanity, that they will literally cheer on a terrorist attack against unarmed Israelis, tourists, and Even Pro-Palestinian activists in kibbutzim fighting for Palestinian rights. And many Pro-Palestinians care almost as much for the plight of these racist Jew-haters, as they care for the innocent children, and the 9% of Adolescents and Adults who can actually bring themselves to call 10/7 a terrorist attack.

Apparently, some influential people have started to take notice and speak up about it.

For reference: Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib (a Gazan and pro-Palestine activist) [comments on Twitter about Secretary Blinken's recent interview](https://twitter.com/afalkhatib/status/1875765202731532455)

""The ""pro-Palestine"" movement's role in prolonging the war on Gaza: Though many are angry with Secretary Blinken’s responses during his interview with the New York Times about Gaza, some of the points he shared are absolutely salient and accurate. I have said this time and again and received immense backlash for doing so: Hamas’s war strategy, statements, behavior, and goals regularly shift and oscillate based on international public opinion, the actions of the “pro-Palestine” solidarity movement, and political statements by world governments, leaders, and institutions against Israel’s war. To be clear, I’m not in any capacity saying I endorse the horrendous war that Israel’s been waging on Gaza, killing a large number of civilians (including my family) and failing to achieve strategic and lasting results 15 months later.

However, Hamas refused to engage in pragmatic negotiations to end the war it started, pulled back several times from closing a ceasefire/hostage deal, and thought that mass civilian casualties would delegitimize Israel and force it to end the war. Many are uncomfortable with Secretary Blinken’s remarks because he shed light on the reality that “pro-Palestine” rhetoric and pressure on Israel has inevitably or perhaps indirectly resulted in a strengthening of Hamas’s position and the overall worsening of the situation for Palestinians in Gaza.

I have said time and again that even if folks wanted to attack and criticize Israeli actions, they should call upon the Islamist group to release hostages and negotiate and off-ramp from the war to implement political transformation. Instead, the “pro-Palestine” and international solidarity movements completely ignored Hamas’s criminality against Palestinians and Israelis alike while failing to promote pragmatic, realistic pathways forward to save the most Palestinian lives and make it clear that Hamas’s actions are unpopular, unsupported, and condemned.

**Secretary Blinken is right on the money with his remarks. The “pro-Palestine” movements across the world after October 7 bear a significant responsibility for prolonging this war and directly contributing to the massive suffering of Palestinians in the coastal enclave. This dereliction of duty delegitimizes almost the entirety of the premise upon which current “pro-Palestine” activism is built. Take a step back and never, ever speak for, over, or on behalf of the Palestinian people!**",Pro-Palestine movement actually makes things worse for Palestinians,0.74,160,0,2025-01-06 16:00:30

The results are as follows:

* Far more Americans (65%) say that Hamas bears a lot of responsibility for the conflict than say that about the Israeli government (35%).
* Much smaller shares of Americans say the Palestinian people (20%) and the Israeli people (13%) have a lot of responsibility for the war.

The part that I found most interesting is the following:

* 41% Americans disapprove of the Biden administration’s response to the war, while 35% approve. Criticism is particularly widespread among young adults (46% vs 19%) and Republicans (51% vs 28%).
* Roughly equal numbers say that Israel is going too far (27%) and that it's taking the right approach (25%).
* Democrats are more likely tend to think that Israel is going too far (45%). On the other hand, only 12% Republicans think that, while 25% say that Israel is _not going far enough_.

I've seen these figures used to support the claim that ""40% of Americans criticise Biden for backing Israel"". That is **not** what the data are suggesting. In fact, over half of those criticising Biden's response are Republicans. Republicans are more likely to say that Biden is favouring Palestinians too much (30% vs 11%) and that Israel should go further in its response (25% vs 12%).

Overall, it seems that Biden is walking a tightrope here: whatever he does, he risks either alienating progressive Democrats or pushing Republicans (and the Republican-leaning) to vote for Trump. His current policy also matches well his identity as a centrist.","Americans’ Views of the Israel-Hamas War (Dec 8, Pew) – interesting results",0.85,30,0,2023-12-10 00:03:48

Loud protests on my university campus today all repeated the same talking points of ‘to the river and the sea’ and to not be ‘complicit in genocide’ ect.. I remain unconvinced by the use of the word genocide and really just want to hear some opinions on this phrasing of the conflict.

My current feelings are it’s an appeal to emotion and a snappy slogan to shout and shut down any discussion of how the situation got to this point. If you mention anything that counters a very narrow view of history, eg. numerous peace offerings/ land deals rejected by Palestine over the years, there’s a common gotcha of ‘so you support genocide?’ which is so obtuse it’s impossible to rebuke. Also, being framed that if you don’t believe it’s a genocide you are now supporting innocent civilian deaths.

To use an (imperfect) analogy, 9/11 killed almost 3000 US civilians and triggered the War on Terror/ Iraq war in which roughly 38 million were displaced and upwards of 4 million killed. Of course these figures are vague due to being over a long timescale, but there’s a similarity to October 7th and the following war, both situations had tensions building for years which culminated in a more intense conflict after these trigger events of 9/11 + 10/7.

I have never heard these vast numbers of displacement and civilian deaths in Iraq/ Afghanistan ect to be described as a genocide or ethnic cleansing, so I’m curious as to why in the case of Israel/ Palestine it is. 

I’d appreciate any thoughts, thank you

I usually discuss this with people in school or mainly read other sub reddits discussing the conflict and I love to see peoples opinions on that… obviously the more that I read, the more rigid minded comments and opinions I see. It’s usually people slowing rhetoric about the other side or hate and not really many discussions. So I’m here to ask y’all this question.

How do you feel this conflict will end?

If your answer is one side not existing at all or, Palestine gaining all the territory or israel gaining all the territory then don’t bother responding, I want actual answers that can be challenged and you’re ready to defend it with common sense. I try to have actual conversations with people about this conflict but it mostly amounts to them screaming at me. By the way I support Israel. 


I know this post is asking you guys a question but for me, I expect the conflict to end with Hamas fully surrendering or just leaving the area. Gaza and West Bank  get turned into some sort of administrative Palestine that is under U.N watch, not Israel. Israel fully pulls out and allow Palestinians to have some sort of ability to move between west bank and Gaza. Is this a bjt unrealistic? Maybe but that’s how I see it ending. Obviously Hamas won’t go down easy but if the Palestinians truly just want peace and nothing more nothing less then that’s how I see it ending in my opinion… so,  what do you guys think?


Edit: so far I’m surprised many people here were respectful, well they weren’t calling me baby killer or anything like that so thank y’all who are responding

Hamas gunmen have been seen on top of some of the vehicles. The group says it is protecting the shipments, while Israel accuses it of stealing aid.  
In the southern Gaza Strip, Hamas acknowledged that a policeman with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry shot dead a 13-year-old boy, saying the shots were fired when a group of people tried to seize aid from a truck near the city of Rafah on Sunday, an official with Hamas government media office said Monday.  
The shooting prompted a violent protest and rare public criticism of Hamas, which has shown little tolerance for dissent during its rule.  
Enraged relatives of the slain boy, Ahmed Brikeh, attempted to attack a police station, burning tires and demanding the policeman be held accountable.  
A relative, Mosaad Brikeh, blamed Hamas for the killing in video comments circulated on social media, accusing the policeman of shooting the boy “directly in his head.”  
He said the family has previously cooperated with Hamas to secure the border area with Egypt. He called for the policeman to be held accountable, warning the family would prevent “any vehicles” from passing through the area.  
The devastation of the war over the past weeks has brought sporadic eruptions of anger against Hamas, something that has previously been unthinkable during the group’s 16-year rule over Gaza.""""

In my opinion, it is clear that HAMAS is stealing international aid. Their first report of this killing blamed the IDF for the killing.

He was routinely invited to [rabbinical assemblies](https://www.jta.org/2012/01/15/default/timeline-mlk-and-the-jews) and honored. His admiration for Jews and Israel most likely came from one of religious admiration, as he had supported Israel prior to the 1967 war. Jews had also shared a common enemy with MLK, as both blacks and Jews suffered severe racism at the time. Jews could pass as white, but they were still routinely excluded from mainstream events.  The KKK did not care about what you stood for, they only cared about what you looked like. He admired Israel for it's democratic values:

&gt;Peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all of our might to protect its right to exist, its territorial integrity. I see Israel, and never mind saying it, as one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land almost can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy.

Keep in mind this was said in 1968, and it is remarkably similar to what your average Zionist would probably say today.

He was also one of the first to speak out against the [Soviet Union's treatment of Jews](https://www.jta.org/archive/dr-martin-luther-king-urges-moscow-to-change-policy-on-jews?_ga=2.140841202.1392765997.1705339055-875049439.1705339055) in 1965:

&gt;I should like to add my voice to the list of distinguished Americans of all faiths who have called the injustices perpetrated against the Jewish community in the Soviet Union to the attention of the world.

It was great for Black-Jewish relations at the time, but unfortunately MLK is not as mainstream anymore. Why does BLM, who sees themselves as the modern day descendants of the civil rights movement, practically ignore everything MLK said about Jews?

Because BLM is a Marxist organization, not a civil rights one and Marxists hate Israel. They are more inspired by the black power movements from the 1960s and look to figures like Malcolm X and Angela Davis, who had routinely expressed sympathies for the PLO and Soviet Union.

Malcom X in 1964, [writes](https://malcolm-x.org/docs/gen_zion.htm):

&gt;The Zionist armies that now occupy Palestine claim their ancient Jewish prophets predicted that in the ""last days of this world"" their own God would raise them up a ""messiah"" who would lead them to their promised land, and they would set up their own ""divine"" government in this newly-gained land, this ""divine"" government would enable them to ""rule all other nations with a rod of iron.""If the Israeli Zionists believe their present occupation of Arab Palestine is the fulfillment of predictions made by their Jewish prophets, then they also religiously believe that Israel must fulfill its ""divine"" mission to rule all other nations with a rod of irons, which only means a different form of iron-like rule, more firmly entrenched even, than that of the former European Colonial Powers.

Sound familiar? It's almost word for word what your average Antizionist would say today. Zionism was a religious movement, not a secular one, and Jews are colonizers and seek to rule the world.

Angela Davis, who was hardly a [civil rights hero](https://forward.com/opinion/417302/angela-davis-human-rights-activist/), was a wild fanatic of the [Soviet Union](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/10/archives/miss-davis-hails-soviets-policies-but-the-comments-on-tour-arouse.html). She had expressed sympathies for terrorists like Leila Khaled and [Rasmea Odeh](https://www.ebony.com/angela-davis-rasmea-odeh-connecting-palestine-prisons-police-495/), who are now lionized today among the anti-Israel left.

When did the shift away from MLK occur? It was most likely when blacks had gotten impatient with progress, and no longer wanted to turn the other cheek. The only way to fight back against racism was by force and to arm themselves. It was an optimal time for communism to infiltrate the civil rights movement, and to start seeing the world in terms of imperialist injustice. In the 1960s, the Black Panthers were a minority group and not as mainstream as MLK. Today, the Black Panthers represent fighting back against a police state and a government that constantly surveils minorities. The shift away from MLK also resulted in increased antisemitism in the black community.

In addition to admiration for the Soviet Union, there was just plain antisemitism as outline by [James Baldwin in 1967.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-antisem.html) [Stokely Carmichael](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/stokely-carmichael) also exemplified the Antizionism in the Black Power movemnet. 

Today, BLM follows the same militarism and Palestinian solidarity that was present in the 1960s. Their stance on colonialism was not exactly a [secret](https://www.adl.org/resources/media-watch/adl-black-lives-matter). In 2019, Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of BLM had [stated](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/black-lives-matters-jewish-problem-in-their-own-words/):

&gt;We realized we need to take our (Palestinian) solidarity a step further. We need to be more public. And so one of the first delegations that went to Palestine was led by the Dream Defenders. It was folks from Ferguson, folks from Black Lives Matter, folks from Dream Defenders, and we went on a solidarity trip… And \[we\] took several delegations to Palestine after that, and I think in some ways have been laying the foundation for the more public face in solidarity. And I think it’s been incredibly powerful for our movement.

Even more horrifying was BLM's open support for [Hamas and 10/7](https://nypost.com/2023/10/10/blm-chicago-under-fire-for-pro-palestine-post-featuring-paragliding-terrorist/). 3 days after the worst massacre of Jews in recent history, one of the biggest BLM chapters had used the same paraglider symbolism that National SJP chapters had.  It wasn't solidarity with Jews, it was a statement intended to be against Israel's alleged settler colonialism and support for ""armed resistance"". Admiration for ""armed resistance"" like that practiced by the Black Panthers.

BLM also takes the view that Israel and the United States brutalize minorities. They point to programs such as the ADL's US-Israel police exchange, and argue that Israel teaches US police officers how to silence minority voices (the program actually teaches about crowd control and anti-terrorist tactics). The organization takes the usual view that Israel is a racist, apartheid state. Since BLM is fighting against racism, it's natural for them to criticize Israel. They attempt to apply an American race-relations framework  to Israel, and it does not fit at all. BLM overlooks the fact that Jews aren't just white, and they intentionally play into the historical revisionism surrounding Israel.

It's time that BLM return to MLK's ideas about Israel, not continue with Malcom X's. To return to MLK would be a remarkable improvement in Black-Jewish relations.",MLK and the Jews,0.72,55,0,2024-01-15 18:16:17

From all sides.

Whether it's:

* A ton of right-wing family and friends in Israel and elsewhere (whose racist and violent screeds I can't handle anymore)
* My left-wing family and Jewish friends in Israel and elsewhere (who are all depressed and crippled with despair like myself)
* My left-wing non-Jewish friends (who haven't a f'ing clue about the details, and are typically trapped in their own white guilt complexes, or tunnel-vision BIPOC oppression matrices)
* Non-moderated forum and comment section internet hellscapes (where the goal is more to troll than make sense)

Almost every person from any group I hear from seems entrenched in their opinion and utterly intolerant to discussion, locked in their own narratives and the same tired talking points, unable to empathize or consider nuance of any kind. This sub is (sometimes) an exception to this.

-----------------

It's easy to criticize the ""other"", especially when you feel wronged or hurt or oppressed. But to me it is the height of arrogance and ignorance to do so without leaving large room for the possibility of being in the wrong and allowing yourself to be challenged by, and more accepting of, those who do live in that experience.

In short, I'm sick of Jews who have nothing bad to say about other Jews or Israel, and Arabs/Muslims who have nothing bad to say about other Arabs/Muslims or the Palestinian side (not to mention the unaligned, those without any skin in the game, who seem to have nothing BUT unfounded, bad faith opinions on the subject). Regardless of what proportion you might believe acceptable or deserved, there can be zero doubt that there is plenty of criticism to go around.

In the spirit of that, and the desire to promote nuance and understanding, here are my ""self-criticisms"" as a Liberal Zionist Jew:

Liberals:

* An across the board lack of understanding towards ethnicities they were not born into, and an unwillingness to accept that there are complex details and conflicting perspectives they may not be able to see or fit into pure cultural relativism
   * which is utterly hypocritical given how they are usually the champions of this same notion
* A critical inability to discern good media sources (hint: not social media) other than to dismiss any that don't fit into or unduly complicate their pre-established narratives as inherently biased or compromised
* Too prone to being easily used or manipulated by those with agendas not in keeping with (or more nefarious than) their own, just because those others appear to dislike the same things
* Relying on reductive slogans instead of thinking twice about any deeper implications

Zionists / Jews (ethnically and politically, not religiously):

* Too convinced of their own moral righteousness in all situations
* Too full of fear and lost in persecution complexes to see any outside criticism as anything other than an existential threat
* Too wrapped up in their own pain narratives to understand how one can be (or become) both victim and victimizer

Now yes, some (or many) of these could apply to other groups, or even to all humans, period. But these are still the things that I believe, if you wish to consider yourself on the ""right side"" of something, that we all need to acknowledge and correct in ourselves and those around us.

-----------------

So please, share your own feelings about what your own group(s) could do better. If at all possible, please try to be honest (both morally and intellectually), and refrain from attacking or discussing groups that are not your own.

Alternately, I would love to hear about a time when you were convinced by, or surprised to discover you agreed with, something that originated from the ""other team"" or an unexpected source.

Good question! Actually, my current view is sort of atypical for me. I took a long and winding road to get here. 

First, demographics are relevant:

I'm a 60f in the midwest ...  a lifelong ""liberal/progressive"" (as I understood these terms) ...  and a former Christian (now atheist). I've known LOTS of Jews in my life — several from Israel, including my childhood best friend. While my former church is connected to certain churches in Israel and Palestine, for decades my brain linked ""Israel"" and ""Zionism"" largely to the Christian Right (a bad thing). I've generally been a peacenik: I organized a peace walk for Christians, Muslims and Jews after 9-11, and marched against Bush's invasion of Iraq in 2003 (just two examples). And I'm a history buff who has studied comparative religion, FWIW. 

Fast-forward to now.

I was in the hospital on Oct 7. (I spent much of the past year hospitalized with a serious illness, which has given me WAY too much time to ponder this stuff.) The first footage I saw was of Shani Louk in the back of a Hamas truck — an image I'll never forget. 

For the first week or so, I didn't feel I knew enough to HAVE an opinion. But I was uncomfortable with pro-Israel celebrities like Jerry Seinfeld, because my political/social circles leaned pro-Palestine and I'm against war generally. But the more blatant the antisemitism became — not only on Twitter and Instagram, but in my own city — the more alarmed I got. Jews I knew IRL were being impacted, and literal Nazis were marching two miles away from my house.

I decided to learn more so I COULD have an opinion. 

I looked into the background on BOTH sides (articles, books, discussion boards, documentaries ... again, I was confined to bed for weeks). And the more I learned, the more I supported Israel. Frankly, I've NEVER supported a military response like I support this one.

  
This DOESN’T mean I support Bibi (OR Trump, God forbid), that I think Israel is perfect, or that I ""hate Palestinian babies"" and ""want Palestinians to starve."" It DOES mean I see Israel's actions not as genocide but a defense against a genocide. Of its own citizens, and Jews worldwide. And I see Israel as a Democratic ally worthy of protection.

    
Here's some factors that I take into account.

**DOUBLE-STANDARDS OF WAR, DANGER &amp; PROXIMITY**

The U.S. military has killed some 4.7 million civilians, both directly and indirectly, *since Sept 11* alone. Does that make civilian deaths okay? No. But most Americans supported these wars *even though our enemies were 7,000 miles away from us* and were *exceedingly unlikely to kill most of us or destroy our nation*. Neither Al Qaeda nor Saddam Hussein were existential threats to the Americans who watched these wars on TV from the other side of the globe.

But Israel's enemy is literally across a fence ... a smaller barrier, in fact, than the ""wall"" protecting us from scary Mexicans (who have not vowed to destroy us and take back their land BTW). Moreover, the events of Sept 11 — horrific as they were — were more symbolic of danger than actually dangerous, having killed ""only"" 3,000 of the 285 million Americans then living in our 3,809,525 sqmi-country.

Israel, OTOH, is smaller than the State of Massachusetts. And since almost half the world's Jews live in Israel, there's at most two degrees of Kevin Bacon — **I mean separation** — between every Jew in the world and an Israeli personally affected by Oct 7 ... and some Jews are old enough to remember when half their population actually WAS wiped out. Honestly, Americans can't imagine. (Bacon, BTW, is Jewish). 

Another issue of proximity: The Gaza Strip's the size of Las Vegas with three times the population, and Hamas hiding among the people, so how CAN Hamas be excised without significant civilian casualties? Look at all the citizens we've killed in countries with much more space.

Again, this doesn't mean civilian casualties are fine, only that Israel is being condemned by countries that have done far worse under less threat. It's these double standards that lead me to believe antisemitism really IS the problem.

**THE SUFFERING OF GAZANS &amp; THEIR NARRATIVE**

For ages, I've heard that Gaza was ""an open-air prison"" and a ""concentration camp."" So I visualized ... well, an open-air prison or a concentration camp. I was actually shocked when I found out what Gaza was like before last fall. (Damn. Reddit won't allow a link or photo. But trust me.) 

Was there poverty and hardship in Gaza? Absolutely. But there were also colleges, theaters, shopping malls, amusement parks, concert halls, resorts, high-end restaurants and 36 hospitals ... none of which one finds in prison or internment camps. 

Also, before last year of course:

&gt;Health and quality of life (in Gaza) vastly exceed the average in most parts of the world - and not just where people are in more obvious need, such as Africa, but even in developed countries like China and areas of South America. The poverty rate in Gaza is 16% - roughly equal to Spain, Germany and California. The rate of poverty is actually higher in Greece, most of the EU, and even parts of the United States, such as Washington D.C. As researcher Daniel Greenfield has pointed out, at 24%, even the poverty rate in Israel is actually 50% higher than in Gaza! Gazans receive more free food aid per month per capita than anyone else in the world, including those living in famine-stricken regions. The average Somali, for example, receives seven times less in aid. The average Zimbabwean, with a life expectancy of 46, also receives about seven times less in food aid than the average resident of Gaza - who has a life expectancy of 73 (even higher than in Russia, Malaysia and neighboring Egypt).

And

&gt;&gt;As of 2017, life expectancy at birth in the Gaza Strip was 75.14 years, higher than Brazil, Peru, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Russia, or Ukraine. There are strains to living in Gaza, and so the territory has a high migration rate, but not quite as high as Lithuania or Latvia. Per capita income in both Gaza and the West Bank is $6,220 per year, far below Israel, but still above much of Central America, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and a number of Pacific islands. Gaza and the West Bank are dense in terms of urban population but far less than Singapore, Kuwait, and Belgium. Even if statisticians separated the West Bank and Gaza in their findings, there remains significant open space and farming in the strip. Unemployment is very high but not as high as in South Africa or Kenya. \~""Is Gaza Really like a Concentration Camp?"" Washington Examiner

Blockades came AFTER threats, attacks and suicide bombings. Border checks exist at EVERY border (as a US citizen, I can't simply waltz into Canada or Mexico). And neither Gazans nor the world protested Egypt's or Jordans' taking safety precautions. The below comes from a post on either Reddit or Quora:

&gt;*When Jordan took (the Palestinians) in, they assassinated the PM, tried to assassinate the king, tried to take over. They also did things like take planes hostage, and use Jordan as a staging area, causing them to be at risk of international reprisal. ... Lebanon took them in. They started a civil war that lasted about a decade, used it as a staging ground for international crimes (like hijacking planes and taking them hostage), and let Lebanon take the brunt of reprisals. Because the government was too busy with the civil war to focus on it. Lebanon still hasn't recovered ... Kuwait took them in. They assisted with Saddam's invasion, and tried to keep it going and take over after Saddam was pushed out ...  Egypt had problems with the Muslim Brotherhood recently (and in fact, Obama supported them) as the M.B. tried to start a civil war and take over. Hamas is the “Palestinian arm” of the Muslim Brotherhood.*

The Palestinians HAVE suffered. But now they've lost everything, and Israel is seen as literally evil. What would any other country have done? Again, it's the double standards that bother me.

**GETTING REAL ABOUT HAMAS &amp; RADICAL ISLAM**

I could write a book about the political impropriety of criticizing Islam, even among liberal Christians and atheists. But, bottom line: Islamist groups (the political/jihadist movements in Islam) are real, and are a real threat, to the Western world and to Jews in particular. I have posted about this numerous times in this sub. Islam is not a race but a set of ideas, and it should be okay to condemn a set of ideas.

True: Most of Gaza's inhabitants in 2023 hadn't even been born in 2006 when Hamas was elected with a plurality of the vote. Moreover, Hamas has never allowed its subjects freedom of speech or thought; while Israel and Egypt have kept Gazans under physical blockade for 17 years, Hamas has kept them under a sort of spiritual one. Such an environment isn't conducive to logic or agency, and Palestine's innocent civilians aren't to be blamed for that. 

That said, however, Hamas IS the de facto government of the Palestinian people and enjoys a high level of support among Gazans even today. We are talking about a group of people who would CHOOSE to live in a region-wide Islamic caliphate governed by Sharia law. **And they don't want a liberal, secular Democracy of Jews smack in the middle of it.**

This conflict isn't about land, ultimately, but about the worldwide spread of Islam. And Hamas wants that much more than it wants to save Palestinian lives, which is why it took actions it knew would trigger a massive military response. Israel's innocent civilians aren't to be blamed for THAT.

**SIDING WITH THE UNDERDOG**

As a liberal, I've always sided with the ""underdog."" I know a lot of American liberals see Muslims as the underdog, which is true within OUR borders. But looking worldwide, I'm baffled that Jews AREN'T seen as the underdog. An great oversimplification, but:

TEAM ONE: Islam — with 1.8 billion members, it accounts for 1/4 of the world's population. It's a proselytizing religion and an expansionist ideology that's been engaged in violent conquest since the 7th Century. In the Qur'an and in Hadiths, Allah expressly demands that Muslims slay their enemies on his behalf. And there's 50 Muslim-majority countries today, many of which afford ZERO rights to non-Muslims (and literally forbid Jews).

vs

TEAM TWO: The Jews — about 16.1 million worldwide, accounting for a mere 0.2% of the world's population. Defined as both a religion and an ethnicity, Judaism has never sought converts nor world conquest, and does not punish apostasy; in fact, almost half the world's Jews are secular. Violent passages in the Old Testament describe historical events in the 1300s BC, not God's standing orders for the present or future. And the creation of the world's single Jewish nation was motivated in large part by the Jews' need for safety after centuries of expulsion and persecution.

So how are the Jews NOT ""The Underdog?"" I don't get it.

As for Israel and ""white privilege:"" In reality, Israel is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. One in five Israelis are Arab; there's significant numbers of Muslims, Druze, Christians and irreligious; and most of Israel's Jews ARE People of Color:

&gt;""I am Mizrahi, as are the majority of Jews in Israel today. We are of Middle Eastern and North African descent. Only about 30% of Israeli Jews are Ashkenazi, or the descendants of European Jews. I am baffled as to why mainstream media and politicians around the world ignore or misrepresent these facts and the Mizrahi story. Perhaps it’s because our history shatters a stereotype about the identity of my country and my people ... Israel, the world’s only Jewish state, was not established for just one type of Jew but for all Jews, from every part of the world — the Middle East, North Africa, Ethiopia, Asia and, yes, Europe.

Hoping that it can be solved is just wishful thinking. Here's why?


I literally can't see why Palestinians would accept Israel's right to exist. They've sacrificed so much so far, to the point that true peaceful coexistence side by side with Israel would make all their sacrifice for nothing. This mindset now outweighs even the potential benefit to the Palestinians' future in a true peaceful coexistence. 



Given the above, I literally can't see how Israel unilaterally leaves the Palestinians 100% alone while taking the risk that the west bank won't become a second Gaza or Lebanon. Without a formal peace deal, Israel needs to take an impossible leap of faith that a Palestinian state won't be hijacked by organizations similar to Hamas / Hizbolla or become a proxy of Israel's enemies.


I don't think that the collective dignity, honor, and sense of purpose of the Palestinians allows them to acknowledge Israel. Think about it: if Palestinians will accept Israel's right to exist, if Palestinians will accept a peaceful coexistence side by side with Israel, then they will have to ask themselves, at a national level: why have we scarified so much until now? We could've made the same peace with Israel 20, 30, 40, or whatever years ago... 


On the other hand, it's impossible for Israel (i.e. the jews) to free itself from the 'siege mentality', and rightfully so. Just look at what happened since 7/10. Just look at what happened for almost a century now: war, after war, after war, after war in a viscous cycle that does not allow jews to feel safe. Do you really think that jews can forget about everything?


If Isarel can't forget, then Israel is doomed to make Palestinian lives miserable, not allowing the Palestinians to forget, which makes the Palestinians' sense of sacrifice even more inherent to the national identity.

What statements and/or atrocities would you need to see before you'd consider calling it genocide? Is there a point at which, in your opinion, it could be genocide, or do you think that the killing of every Palestinian would still not be genocide?

I ask this because the arguments I've seen against calling what's happening in Gaza a genocide have gotten a lot worse than they were in September. People who say things like ""the Palestinians aren't a people, so it can't be genocide"", ""no matter how many people they kill, genocide is about intent, not the number of deaths"" (this might make sense if we were just talking about combatants, but we're not), or ""they're just lying about the number of deaths, and they can't be trusted to tell the truth about what's happening to them"" are saying the kinds of things people have always said to cover up genocide.

Denying the existence of the people you're accusing of committing genocide against is a classic way to deny an active genocide. So is saying they can't be trusted to tell the world what's happening to them. Claiming that the destruction of a large portion of an ethnic group is a convenient way to achieve a legitimate military objective is a bit more complicated, but that sounds more like an excuse for genocide than an actual denial, and I don't think there are any excuses for genocide.

I believe that killing everyone in Gaza, or a significant portion of the population of Gaza, would be genocide. I would consider doing something that a reasonable person would believe would result in the death of a large portion of an ethnic group to be genocide or attempted genocide, and advocating such an overt act is advocating genocide. The people who call for things like ""leveling Gaza,"" knowing that Palestinian civilians have no way to leave and that such a small area could only support a small fraction of the existing population without urban infrastructure, are calling for genocide.

What do you think they would have to do before it could be called genocide? What would you do if you thought the Israeli government was committing genocide?

Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not asking if Israel is currently committing genocide, that's an argument people have had many times on this forum.

I'm asking what they would have to do for you to consider it genocide.

Hi.  I’ve posted on this subreddit before, almost entirelyin replies.  I’ve exchanged messages with some very thoughtful people, and I’ve also exchanged messages with some very cringe people.  

I’m 43 years old and have been following the conflict from afar my entire life.  It’s deeply emotional to me, profoundly personal, and it’s a conflict that is inseparable from my identity.  The horror of October 7th and the horrors in Gaza and the West Bank that followed have taken a toll on me, my family and our community.  I personally have become despondent, sensing that both sides are on a decline with no brakes, only escalating violence, and more generations of hatred and animosity.  

When faced with other problems in life, I try to start with the possible outcomes and work backwards to find the path to that outcome.  Can you help me with this thought exercise.  In my mind, there are only four potential long term outcomes:

1) ethnic cleansing - Israel ethnically cleanses millions of Palestinians from the holy land, and annexes the West Bank and Gaza with a Jewish super majority across all the land.  

2) ethnic cleansing - Palestinians align themselves with different power players and over time the strength of Israel and its allies wanes and Palestinians ethnically cleanse the holy land of Israelis and establish a Palestinian state with a Palestinian super majority across all the land.  

3) one state solution - equal rights for all, no need to fully describe.  

4) two state solution - each state fully sovereign 

For the longest time I was certain that a two state solution was going to happen.  It made so much sense and seemed to have the backing of western powers.  Now, with settlement expansion continuing aggressively and over 500k Israelis living in the West Bank, I don’t know how we get to two states.  

For a short while, I thought a one state solution could work.  But I think Israelis want a majority Jewish state, which is understandable (I guess), and Israelis don’t trust Palestinians, which is understandable given the history of terror attacks.  

A Palestine from sea to sea that ethnically cleanses Israelis seems so very far fetched that it’s not even worth considering.

Are we then left with only one other option?  The ethnic cleansing of Palestinians?

Warning: It's as interesting as it is shocking, but facts are facts and there's no other way around it. If you don't like it, you just have to put up with it.
Let's start with the movie...

The map calls what is now Israel ""Palestine"" because Raiders of the Lost Ark takes place in 1936, and at that time, the region was a British colony called the British Mandate of Palestine. So the movie is historically accurate.

Now take note: the name Palestine was not given because there was a Palestinian nation, a Palestinian country, or a Palestinian people ""sovereign in their own land."" It was called that BECAUSE IT WAS A COLONY. THE BRITISH gave it that name.

But then WHAT WAS IT CALLED BEFORE?
You may be surprised, but it was NOT called Palestine. In fact, it did not exist as a province. The area was divided into small provinces, some governed from Beirut, others from Damascus.

There it is called Palestine, but only because the map is from an English book. The Ottomans (who ruled the region at the time) did not call it that.
In fact, NO Islamic domain called it Palestine in the sense of a country, province or nation.

For Muslims, Filastín was only a regional name that served as an alternative to the ""Holy Land."" Why? Because that was the name given to it by the Romans before the Arab conquest. That is why Muslims were never interested in the name.

Technically, the region was always seen by Islam as a mere extension of Sham (Syria), although for administrative reasons the coastal regions were governed from Beirut.
For Islam there NEVER existed a country called Palestine with a people called Palestinians.

The first Muslims who began to speak of Palestine in official terms were the Ottomans, right in the middle of the 19th century.
But look at the reasons for this: at that time, the English presence had increased significantly in the region.

Political crises in the area during the 1830s put the Ottoman authorities at risk. Mehmet Ali, the governor of Egypt, took control of the region and had serious plans to attack Istanbul. He might have succeeded, but the English intervened.

Unable to confront the British army after a fierce bombardment of Beirut, Ali returned to Cairo, and the Ottomans regained control of the area. Ties with England were thus strengthened, and the British consulate was then granted several privileges.

One of them was that all Europeans residing in the ""Holy Land"" were placed under British jurisdiction. Most Jews benefited from this same provision. Thus, although they lived in Ottoman territory, they were governed by English laws.

This legal curiosity - British jurisdiction in Ottoman territory - was what the Ottomans themselves called Palestine. That is, they themselves understood the concept of ""Palestine"" to be something shared by Christians and Jews, but alien to Islam.

Why?
Simple: because in the sacred narrative of Islam, Palestine has no importance. The only place that stands out is Jerusalem, called Al-Quds (The Holy). But this special status is limited to the city and its surroundings, not to the entire territory.

However, in Jewish and Christian religious narratives, the regions of Judea, Samaria and Galilee have a capital importance because they are where the history of ancient Israel takes place, or where Jesus of Nazareth walked.

In 135, Emperor Hadrian ordered a name change and these three provinces were renamed Palestine. But it was just that: a name change. Conceptually, the idea was not altered for either Jews or Christians.

In the 19th century, when a Jew or a Christian spoke of Palestine, he understood the concept perfectly. Muslims did not. For them, the name was only an anachronistic geographical reference, foreign to their religion.

Now, if Muslims did not imagine the existence of Palestine as something concrete, EVEN LESS so did they imagine the existence of a ""Palestinian people"" as something equally concrete. The inhabitants there were simply Arabs or Shamis Muslims. That is, Syrians.

So much so that even in the 20th century, Haffez el-Assad, the Syrian dictator (father of Bashar el-Assad) insisted that Israel had to be destroyed, and the territory incorporated into Syria, because ""THAT HAD BEEN THE WAY IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY"".

So do not be fooled, readers of good will.

It's like if you open your mouth and say ""I am a toaster."" You are not a toaster, and Israel is not doing ethnic cleansing.    

Arab israelis and Palestinians are not different ethnicities.  Or am I mistaken about that? 

I'm sure there are some aspects of this I'm misunderstanding, and for all I know maybe you really are a toaster. I don't have all the answers.  

But the Arabs who didn't get displaced (when 7 nations ganged up on the jews) in 1948 did not suddenly become a new ethnicity when they were instantly accepted as israeli citizens.

Or do some people really thing a new ethnicity sprang into existence in 1948 when some arabs became israelis? 

If you think Palestinians and Israeli Arabs are different ethnicities, that would mean if the anti-zionists had their way and abolished israel, the Arabs who had been Israeli citizens would be... a separate ethnicity from other arabs in the region? 

It's like.. just picking up your own credibility and throwing it as far away as you can....

You could say israeli arabs contribute to israeli *culture*, but ""culture"" and ""ethnicity"" are different words.  The whole point of having different words is so they can mean different things.  

Also, most definitions of ethnic ""cleansing"" involve trying to make a region ethnically homogeneous... but... even if you try to say ethnic cleansing only means *removing* people of a particular ethnicity it's still absolutely a non-starter.  It's silly. 

*Unless* you see Israel trying to expel israeli arabs.  But of course they're not, and everyone knows it.    

It's perfectly cogent if someone says, ""Israel wants to force Palestinians into Egypt,"" because even though it's not true it at least makes sense, since Palestinians attack Israel over and over and the Jews are trying to survive.  

But as soon as you say ""ethnic cleansing"" it's like you're schizophrenic and hallucinating dragons and elves and stuff.  

I do not mean any disrespect to dragons of elves or schizophrenic people.  That's not the point.  I'm just saying, you could literally pee on my leg and tell me it's raining and that would be less incorrect than saying Israel wants to do ethnic cleansing.  

Unless you see Israelis trying to cleanse the region of Arab Israeli citizens, blurting out ""ethnic cleansing! ethnic cleansing!"" is like.. egg-on-your-face.  

It's like going on stage to give a TED talk, and you have a whole carton of eggs all broken on your face, all oozing down your shoulders and people can't tell if you're being serious or if this is some weird joke. 

Because words mean things.  It's not ""genocide"" if no one is interested in eradicating a group of people, and it's not ""ethnic cleansing"" if the only people israel wants to remove are the ones who (regardless of ethnicity) keep attacking israel over and over.

It's so controversial apparently, that it's hard to have any civil conversation about it. But I'm genuinely curious. It appears to me that a fundamental question in the Israel-Hamas conflict is, ""Who do you trust?"" We have two sides presenting conflicting details and evidence. In a world where it's so easy to spread misinformation, I think that whoever is more trustworthy is more likely to be in the right here. In the same way we have certain trusted news sources and certain less trustworthy news sources, if Hamas and their evidence of ""Israeli Occupation"" is more trustworthy, then their campaign against Israel is justified. However, the opposite is also true. If Israel and their evidence of ""Hamas Atrocities"" is more trustworthy then Israel's campaign against Hamas is justified.

I'm genuinely curious because it appears almost obvious to me that the dishonest, untrustworthy one here is Hamas. It appears to me that Hamas is known for lying about civilian casualties based on at least the following accounts:

1. They deny killing civilians on October 7th despite clear video evidence otherwise from Go-Pros that have been independently verified, on their own soldiers.
2. There is independently verified evidence of them operating out of, and building tunnels in, civilian areas which they also deny.
3. A significant percentage (between 10%-30% depending on the source) of the rockets fired at Israel fail to leave Gaza, thus making it additionally difficult to identify the source of civilian deaths but I haven't seen them take responsibility for this at all. In fact, I've seen people rush to blame Israel.
4. There is significant evidence of them operating while wearing civilian clothing which again makes it difficult to identify whether a death is a civilian or a Hamas soldier.
5. The number reported by the Hamas-run Health Ministry never distinguishes between Gazan civilians and Hamas soldiers and sources all deaths to ""Israeli Aggression"".

Israel, on the other hand, appears to be honest in its admission of firing rockets into civilian areas even though they claim to be targeting Hamas soldiers. But, especially considering the above, I'd find it difficult for people to claim they are targeting civilians (ethnic cleansing, and genocide are the terms I hear) for the following reasons:

1. All the above (it's hard to believe they're targeting civilians when the evidence of civilians being killed in the first place is so filled with lies)
2. Israeli technology is more focused on defense (Iron Dome, Iron Beam, they build bomb shelters for their people) certainly compared to Hamas, and in general has been more reactive than offensive. Hamas leadership has even stated that they are not responsible for protecting the people of Gaza.
3. The Hamas charter has the clearly stated goal of wiping Israel off the map and killing all Jews, while there is no comparative legal document that exists in Israel saying the same about Gaza, any of the neighboring countries, or Muslims in general.
4. Israel has done more than any other country at war ever to protect civilian casualties by dropping leaflets, giving warnings, knocking on roofs, and even creating pathways for evacuation in the very country they are at war with.
5. The Israeli educational curriculum does not include incitement of violence towards the Palestinians (or Muslims in general) as compared to the Gazan educational curriculum (see comparison below):
   1. The Gazan educational system does not mention and specifically removes all mentions of peace being an option in the region.
   2. They describe ALL of Israel as being ""occupied"", not just Gaza
   3. They encourage students to sacrifice their lives in the name of religion. Textbooks for children and early teens provide dramatic stories of martyrdom followed by an implicit call to die for the cause.
   4. The only mitigating factor here is that the Israeli educational systems also describe them as enemies but they're still specific to ""terrorist groups"" and not ethnic cleansing.
6. 20% of Israel is Muslim and can vote in free elections while 0% of Gaza is Jewish and there are no free elections.

All the above appears to make a very strong case that Hamas is not trustworthy and would, dare I say it, even be largely responsible for civilian deaths. Hamas has even recruited children (under 18) as soldiers in the past, further muddying the ""civilian death"" waters. So I'm genuinely curious to hear what people would say in response. Hopefully, I'll get a reply that objectively analyses my points rather than attacking me personally.

The general problem with war is that it's extremely difficult to develop appropriately nuanced positions. There is a conflict between the realistic, practical needs of war and the deep nuances of responsibility for every individual involved. An army can't be so nuanced that they look at every instance in the utmost depth and weigh all the evidence to determine if someone is guilty or not (whoever did that would die from the amount of time it would take to make decisions). But at the same time, they can't be so vague that they paint the entire conflict in broad strokes because then you end up killing people who are not responsible. (As an example, international law doesn't allow for the killing of civilians but isn't nuanced enough to explain what to do when enemies are entrenched in civilian areas.)

I'm looking for significant qualitative differences. Everyone lies, misdirects, and makes mistakes. So what I'm looking for is strong qualitative evidence that either:

1. my points are incorrect (I don't want to get into the, ""he said she said"" arguments so please try to find independent sources. If you quote a reputable Israeli source that's pro-Palestinian or a Palestinian source that's pro-Israel, that's fine.)
2. or that there exists evidence of the same qualitative proportion (Very important. I'm looking for an attempt to recognize the nuances), of Israel being equally untrustworthy. An oft-quoted example is Israel's original denial of killing the Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akhla without repercussion and then admitting to it soon after when evidence was brought to light. If you're bringing evidence of systemic intent to lie and kill, I'd like to highlight the qualitative difference in Hamas's denial of killing 1,200 civilians vs Israel's denial of killing a single journalist. Let me make myself clear, please be capable of differentiating between the number of people needed to be involved in order to lie about a single civilian's death vs 1,200.",How can anyone trust Hamas?

I think that, strategically, it is an excellent time to invade the US. With their current political division, and their ongoing support of the Russo-Ukrainian War and Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, they will be ill-focused on our incursion into their territory. Additionally, they are fairly disliked throughout the world, so they would get little backing, while we could get much military support from the likes of China and Iran, as well as much of Europe. Furthermore, we take into account the events of the 1812 war and our track record for war crimes in past wars, I think we’ll have them surrendering and ceding territory within a few months. Even if they do manage to beat us back, they won’t be able to beat our advanced Winter combat tactics, like wearing white camouflage, or building igloos.

Here is my suggested war goal: claiming the states of Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, New York, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. Additionally, I think our secondary goal should be to cripple their maple syrup industry, so that we can further cement ourselves as the maple syrup titan in the Northern Hemisphere. 

With this, I humbly present my plan to dethrone the US and rocket Canada into being one of the most powerful nations in the world. Now, let’s go get those Yanks.

**Just Stop Fighting**

 Basically it means just stopping the current fighting. It means that Hamas stays in Power; it means that the hostages are not released. Then, Israel must remain highly alert and respond to any potential threats, planning, or attempts similar to the  7th of October. It also means, from the Israeli point of view, that any response should be highly aggressive to make sure it stays safe.



**Bringing in a Peacekeeping Force:**

For me, this sounds like science fiction: Let's bring an international peacekeeping force. Who would be willing and able to take on this role? We have seen that Spanish Politicians supporting Palestine are not even willing to move to Ramallah; how many would be willing to fight and risk their lives here? Even  Arab countries have shown reluctance to get involved directly. So, who will be the soldiers on the ground if you like this option? 



**The Hostages Issue:**

One of the main points that are ignored (by pro-pals) about the ceasefire is the hostages. Usually, it involves a comparison that is behind evil: People (Gazans / West Bank people) who were involved in planning and executing attacks on civilians cannot be equal to those who were simply attending a party and were kidnapped.



There are many more points, but I wanted to bring the main ones to start the discussion and show the problems in the commonly proposed ideas.

Would it take the United States' withdrawal of its billions of dollars of aid? Or maybe sanctions imposed on Israel proper (not just the settlements/settlers)? 

Would it take finding out that they keep Palestinians in caves in the Sinai to make silk jackets for them and when they don't make the jackets fast enough, they unleash flying centipedes into the cave? 

Would it take going into Gaza to witness the destruction everyone is talking about for yourself? There's plenty of videos but those don't seem to count.

Would it take evidence of legitimate work camps? Please, do not say I'm equating this conflict to the Holocaust, because that would be a very disingenuous interpretation of my question. I'm using the camps as a reference as to where the line is drawn in terms of what y'all would consider to be blatant genocide/ethnic cleansing/disproportionate violence.

Would it take a nuclear bomb?

What aren't they doing right now that if they did do, you would begin to question their motives? 

Is there anything? 

I'm hoping for honest, genuine answers. Arguing about October 7 or Hamas would not be on topic for my question. I say this because I have tried asking this question elsewhere and I just keep getting redirects. I want actual answers. I want to know where y'all are coming from.

Thank you in advance.

A coordinated network of veteran Wikipedia editors has been shaping narratives around Israel, Palestine, and affiliated groups with an aggressive bias, intensifying efforts particularly after the October 7 events.

This group systematically sanitizes articles, removing favorable references to Israel, minimizing or reframing content that would implicate extremist affiliations of Hamas, and directing focus instead toward alleged wrongdoings attributed to Israel. The reach and organization of these editors enable them to control narrative direction and shape public perception across thousands of Wikipedia articles, fundamentally altering the tone and context of related content.

Leading editors like Iskandar323 and Selfstudier act as central figures in this coordinated campaign, meticulously excising content they find objectionable or that may cast Palestine or its allies in a negative light. For example, they’ve erased references to Amin Al-Husseini's collaboration with Nazi Germany, a significant historical note that would inform understanding of certain ideological influences on Palestinian leadership. By suppressing such context, the editors foster a carefully curated pro-Palestinian slant, often overlooking or omitting facts that might support Israel's perspectives.

Adding a new layer to this campaign, the ""Tech for Palestine"" (TFP) group has emerged, coordinating efforts through Discord to train volunteers in tactics for shaping Wikipedia’s coverage. TFP instructs participants on how to alter narratives to be overtly pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel, providing detailed guidance on evading Wikipedia's scrutiny by working in small, rotating teams to avoid detection. The group has even extended its influence beyond Wikipedia, attempting to influence UK Members of Parliament and shape the broader political discourse.

These tactics employ a systematic approach to manipulating Wikipedia’s content guidelines, subtly evading detection by avoiding direct violation of editorial policies and making incremental, coordinated changes. The result is a steady propagation of anti-Israel narratives that skew the information available to casual readers and impact search engine outputs, such as Google's knowledge panels, that rely on Wikipedia as a primary source.

The propaganda strategies employed here reveal the platform's vulnerabilities, exploiting Wikipedia’s volunteer-driven moderation model and limited oversight resources, making it difficult for genuine editors to counterbalance these narratives. As a result, Wikipedia has become susceptible to coordinated efforts that shape the public’s perception of contentious issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, allowing organized groups to push ideologically driven, often anti-Israel agendas. This manipulation distorts the platform’s intended neutrality and informs global perspectives with increasingly one-sided narratives on complex geopolitical issues.

A few major points from the start of the article itself:

* A coordinated campaign led by around 40 Wikipedia editors has worked to delegitimize Israel, present radical Islamist groups in a favorable light, and position fringe academic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict as mainstream over past years, intensifying after the October 7 attack
* Six weeks after October 7, one of these editors successfully removed mention of Hamas’ 1988 charter, which calls for the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel, from the article on Hamas
* The group also appeared to attempt to promote the interests of the Iranian government across a number of articles, including deleting “huge amounts of documented human rights crimes by [Islamic Republic Party] officials”
* A group called Tech For Palestine launched a separate but complementary campaign after October 7, which violated Wikipedia policies by coordinating to edit Israel-Palestine articles on the group 8,000 member Discord
* Tech For Palestine abandoned its efforts and its members went into a panic after a blog discovered what they were doing; the group deleted all its Wiki Talk pages and Sandboxes they had been using to coordinate their editing efforts, and the main editor deleted all her chats from the group’s Discord channel",How Wikipedia’s Pro-Hamas Editors Hijacked the Israel-Palestine Narrative,0.77,145,0,2024-10-25 13:38:37

Jews are indigenous to Judea and have lived there for thousands of years. The European Jews (who are around 50% genetically Judean), were almost wiped out in a holocaust because of their non-whiteness, while Middle Eastern and African Jews were persecuted in their own countries. The majority of Jews arrived as refugees to Israel.

The local Arabs (who are mostly also indigenous) were not displaced until they waged their genocidal war. There were much larger population transfers at this time all around the world as borders were changing and new countries were being formed. It is disingenuous and frankly insulting to call this 'settler colonialism'. Which nation is Israel a colony of? They had no allies at the beginning at brutally fought against the British for their independence, who prevented holocaust survivors from seeking refuge in the British Mandate.

Israel is not an 'ethnostate'. It is a Jewish state in the same way a Muslim state is Muslim and Christian state is Christian. It welcomes Jews from all over the world. More than half of the Jews in Israel come from Middle Eastern or African countries. The Druze, Samaritans and other indigenous minorities are mostly Zionists who are grateful to live in Israel. 2 million mostly peaceful Muslims live and prosper in Israel with equal rights.

Some people even call Israel 'white supremacist', which I'm convinced nobody actually believes. Jews are almost universally hated by white supremacists for not being white. Probably only around 20% of the collective DNA of Israel is 'white'.

Due to the history of massacre and holocaust, and their status as a tiny minority, if *anyone* would have the right to have a Jewish ethnostate, it would be Jews, and yet it is less of an ethnostate than virtually every surrounding country, where minorities are persecuted. Please research the ways Palestinians are treated in Lebanon and Jordan, where they are banned from certain professions, from owning property, from having full citizenship, all so they can be used as a political tool to put pressure on Israel.

Do activists who use these terms not know anything about Israel, or are they intentionally trying to antagonise people?

This is a part of the “***Realities of War***” series that got somewhat of a following last year.  The purpose of the series is to share first-hand experience and “realities” of warfighting with well-meaning observers who’ve had a good fortune of going through life without getting shot at.  You’ll find links to my older posts at the bottom of this one. 

I don’t claim to be fully objective – my bias is quite obvious.  That said, I do my best not to “preach” or bloviate on philosophical topics and try to stick to the pragmatic realities of things that happen when one group of dudes (*it’s almost always dudes*) decides that it’s a good idea to start shooting at other dudes… and the other group of dudes decide to shoot back.    

This particular post was prompted by a post from u/IcarianComplex, which you can find here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1hvebsj/if\_israel\_isnt\_the\_most\_moral\_army\_in\_the\_world/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1hvebsj/if_israel_isnt_the_most_moral_army_in_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

The question at hand is regarding “*morality*” when comparing military action.  Main thesis forward -  I believe that the question of “morality” of this military force or another is a fundamentally misguided question (from practical standpoint).

Let’s expand (as usual… this post is quite lengthy).    

# A good military is akin to a GOOD guard dog. 

Asking a military to be “moral” is like asking whether a guard dog is “friendly”.  If it’s “friendly” – it’s no longer a guard dog.  If it’s a guard dog, the better questions would be along the lines of “does the owner have control of the dog”?  “Is the dog well trained”?  “Is the owner an asshole”?

A military has a similar function to a guard dog – hence the analogy.  Just like a guard dog, it needs to be capable of extreme violence.  Otherwise, it’s no longer an effective guard dog. Hence, the first simple criteria for a “*good*” military is  - “*is it good at violence*”?  IDF is quite good at the violence part of its job and it's not the question we’re discussing… so, we’ll set the analysis of IDF’s combat effectiveness aside. 

The second important criteria for a “*good*” guard do is – “*Does the owner have control of it*”?  Examples of a “*bad*” guard dog would be Argentinian or Brazilian Juntas, for instance – the “guard dogs” that forgot their role and decided that they should just own the house.  In that sense – IDF seems to be at least a decent guard dog.

A “*good guard dog*” doesn’t happen overnight.  It’s a product of long tradition, values, and structures of the larger society, political systems in place, etc. etc.  But that’s a topic for a different discussion.     

# A “good dog” military is a mirror held to the society it serves.

A “*guard dog*” military (rather than a ""*rabid""* dog) is always just a mirror image of the larger society.  In other words – if the larger society (its customs, values, political structures) is a mess – the military will be a mess.  If the society is racist – the military will be racist.  If the society is corrupt – the military will be corrupt.  If the power structures in the society are driven by nepotism – the power structures in the military will be driven by nepotism.  Etc.  etc. 

In other words – the “morals” inside the military are always just a reflection of the “morals” of its society. 

Let’s underline this again – there is no such thing as a “moral” Army.  There are just societies.  The less moral societies will have less moral militaries.  And the more moral societies will have more moral militaries.  It’s really that simple.  A “rabid dog” military is a thing – yes… it can happen when the society doesn't have an established military tradition and strong institutions of control.  But, **provided that the military knows and respects its place (like a ""*****good dog*****"") – it will be no more and no less “moral” than its society**. 

Let’s look at an example.  The Imperial Japanese army of WW2 was notoriously brutal – and not only toward the enemy.  Were they immoral?  Well… it depends on which set of lenses you’re using.  By the standards of the western civilization – they were animalistic.  But the Japanese society of the time was a much more brutal place.  Surrendering was an act of cowardice to them – treating enemy POWs as despicable cowards wasn’t a particularly “immoral” act to the Japanese… it was to be expected.  They also viewed themselves as the “superior race” – again, their behavior toward “lesser” people they occupied really wasn’t out of character for the society that the Japanese military represented at the time.  Etc. etc. 

Hence, asking a military to “learn” morality from doctrines of other nations is a pointless exercise.  They can learn technical skills from other nations’ militaries.  They can learn strategy, tactics, command structure… but a military will never learn “morals” from anyone other than their own society. 

# Taking the dog off the leash.

Is it possible for a relatively “moral” military (*i.e. a military fielded by a relatively “moral” nation*) to act immorally on a battlefield?

Yes, and it happens all the time.  And this is where things get complicated. 

First, it’s important to understand that (just like in a larger society) some small percentage of soldiers, in any military, will be psychotic, antisocial types.  It’s a very small percentage and you can’t really control for it fully.

Very small percentage of such psychopaths/sociopaths aside – it’s important to remember that the vast majority of soldiers hold morals and values in line with their own society.  In other words, most soldiers don’t set out to murder a bunch of people.  They are a military  - the job does inherently means violence.  But its violence with guardrails.  Most soldiers intuitively understand those guardrails (*before they’re even made explicit with things like ROEs*) and they set out to do their job, within those guardrails. 

Another important context to keep in mind is that a war (or a military operation) is not a one, coherent “thing”.  Rather, it’s an extremely complicated… very chaotic… very violent ballet.  Except, you can’t see the conductor… you can’t always hear the music… you have no idea what the other dancers are doing… and the audience occasionally shoots at you. 

The “world” of any given military unit is quite small.  They play their small part in a much larger war machine.  On any given operation, most commanders on the ground don’t have a comprehensive view of the battlefield.  A platoon commander will have a basic understanding of their brigade’s movement and strategic intent, a bit more nuanced understanding of their battalion’s role in the larger intent, and much more clear understanding of his company’s task in the larger role of the battalion. 

Once that platoon commander goes back to his platoon – his view of the world shrinks.  He knows what the rest of the company is up to.  He can make assumptions about how the battalion is doing.  As far as the larger elements – he can only hope that they’re doing what they’re supposed to.  But, when the enemy is shooting at you – your world shrinks.  You have three things in your mind:  (a) your commander’s larger intent (critical piece of information); (b) your element’s task within your commander’s larger intent; (c) the reality on the ground that’s unfolding in front of you. 

# Scenario

Let’s say you’re a platoon commander, and your company is tasked with securing a bridge that the entire battalion will later move across.  You know that (a) your platoon is the first across the bridge; (b) the entire battalion of a thousand people is anxiously waiting to move; and (c) the entire brigade’s mission depends on the battalion securing the neighborhood (which needs your bridge to get into the neighborhood to begin with).

Intelligence did not see suspected enemy movements on the other side of the bridge.  But the enemy has tunnels – hence, it’s a coin toss.  Let’s imagine you lead a platoon of U.S. Army Rangers – highly skilled and disciplined war fighters… among the best line units in the world. 

So, you get across the bridge and… what do you know… the neighborhood opens up on you. What do you do? 

I’ll tell you what you’re going to do – you’re going to level that f-ing neighborhood.  It doesn’t matter what you think your values are.  Faced with such a scenario – you are destroying that neighborhood and killing a whole lot of people.  You can tell yourself fairy tales…  tell yourself that you’d be “smarter”… “more thoughtful”…. Etc.  I’m here to tell you that you won’t.  You will do exactly what thousands of highly skilled, thoughtful, professional commanders have done thousands of times in the past century alone – you will level that neighborhood and, if the civilians happen to be there, you will kill those civilians.  Period, the end. 

Does that make you “immoral”?  No… that simply makes you a commander presented with a shitty situation.  No one made an error.   No one deliberately targeted civilians.  But you have a city that needs to be taken, you have a bridge that you have to get across, etc. – those are the cards.  You will simply play that cards that you're dealt - go in and do your job. 

The situation I described above is more or less “*black and white*”… by the standards of a ground invasion.  The reality, more often than that, is much more “gray”.  But similar scenarios, in a ground invasion, happen multiple times DAILY to different elements across the battlespace.

# A “Professional” military is as close as you can get to a “moral” military.

At the end of the day (*provided that the military was fielded by a more-or-less moral societ*y) – the only assurance of “morality” in war comes from the overall professionalism of your forces. 

Because most soldiers don’t set out to deliberately murder other human beings – the “atrocities” in war happen when an underprepared unit encounters a bad situation and deals with it by shooting at everything that moves (this holds true not just for the forces on the ground, but also for the airborne assets supporting the invasion). 

The more skilled and trained your military is – the less likely such scenarios are to occur.

**Side note**:  such scenarios will ALWAYS happen.  Such is the nature of war.  An enemy that resists will shoot at you.  No one likes to be shot at.  Soldiers will shoot back.  Highly trained soldiers will do their best to know what they’re shooting at and be as precise as possible.  Poorly trained soldiers will just wildly shoot at everything that moves.  I’m oversimplifying, of course – but the basic premise holds true even for the most complex scenarios. 

But even the most skilled military will occasionally encounter situations where the only answer is to level the entire city block. Think Mogadishu in 1993.  Those weren’t conscripts – we’re talking U.S. Army Rangers and Combat Applications Group (“Delta Force”)… flown on target by the elite Night Stalkers.  And yet, the situation turns to shit – and they end up having to kill hundreds of Somalis just to extract themselves from that mess.        

# “Professionalism” is a practical substitute for “Morality”. 

Contemplating morality is a luxury – one that’s hard to afford on a battlefield.  Hence (again, provided that the military in question was fielded by a moral society to begin with... and the soldiers aren’t a gang of barbarians) … the best substitute for “morality” is plain “professionalism”. 

What does it mean?  It simply means setting a CLEAR objective, and then achieving that objective as quickly as possibly, while (a) minimizing your own casualties; and (b) not destroying things that don’t need to be destroyed in order to achieve such an objective. 

In other words, a PROFESSIONAL military doesn’t do things out of emotion.  It chooses targets (to the extent possible) via a combination of (a) its own abilities; (b) strategic priority; and (c) downstream tactical necessity.

**Example**: when invading certain places, there were numerous villages that would shoot at us.  Does it mean that we would destroy such a village every time?  Not at all.    

For instance, if our strategic objective is an airfield 10 miles past the village, the village holds no tactical necessity, and we’re able to bypass it – then we would gladly bypass it and go after our objective.  No need to drop artillery on it and risk killing civilians. 

However, that’s a very simple decision – a luxury of sorts in a war. 

Things change in an urban battlefield.  When the entire city itself is the objective – things get much, much more complicated. 

I wrote about the challenges of invading a city at length previously – not going to repeat myself.  You can check out my previous posts. 

# Conclusion

Trying to compare “morality” of one military vs. another is quite pointless.  Trying to teach “morality” to a military is a fool’s errand.

Again, the relevant questions are:

* What is the society that originated the military in question like?  Is it a “moral” society?  How corrupt is it?  How technologically competent is it?  Etc.
* Does that society exercise full control over its military or is its military a rogue element?
* Is the military itself highly trained and professional?
* Does the military have experience in that specific theatre?
* What is the nature of the battlespace? (A city is a much different battlespace than invading a large piece of desert, for instance)
* What’s the enemy like?  (Fighting a somewhat organized and identifiable force (such as the Republican Guard, for instance) is an entirely different beast than fighting a bunch of Islamist lunatics in their literal back yard). 

 

# My own two cents

Here is my own take… being as objective as possible.  Keep in mind – half of my family is Muslim, I’ve never been to Israel, I have no plans to go to Israel.  And I dislike all forms of religious fundamentalism – including fundamentalism of both Muslim and Jewish variety.

That said, given the circumstances… I don’t see how ANY other military would be able to go about fighting Hamas (given 15 years of entrenchment, the fanatism, the insane tunnel system) in a way any more effective or “moral” than what IDF did. 

That’s just the cold, hard reality.   I’m a former American war fighter.  It doesn’t really get more professional or trained than the U.S. Armed forces.  But I’m here to tell you – we wouldn’t be able to do the same job any better or “cleaner” than IDF did.   Period, the end. 

 Now, you can ask questions all day long on whether IDF should have invaded Gaza to begin with – that’s a matter of opinion.  Mine is irrelevant – that’s not the topic of this post. 

But, once the decision to invade Gaza was made – there isn’t a military in the world that would’ve done a “better” job than IDF, given the circumstances.

This isn't based on some particular ""affection"" for IDF.  I don't know anyone in IDF, never worked with them.  And, quite frankly, IDF is mostly a conscripted military - and my first impulse is to be highly suspicious of any conscripted military to begin with.   

Sure, we (Americans) probably would’ve done some things a bit differently.   But the end result would be the same.  The number of dead civilians would be the same.  The destruction would be the same.  Etc. 

An urban war offers very few “moral” routes to seizing an objective – even to the “moral” side.  And Hamas clearly was not in the mood to offer any “moral” pathways to IDF… that would entail actually given an ounce of shit about their own population.  And Hamas couldn’t be bothered to do that. 

 

**P.S.**  Understand this – when you build two miles of weaponized tunnels under each square mile of your city – you make the “ENTIRE” city a military target.  Even the most “moral” military is out of options when presented with that reality. 

When people tell you that “*Hamas is hiding behind civilians*” – that’s not accurate, actually.  Saying this creates an image of a “bad guy behind a child” in the minds of well-meaning civilians, and that’s not precisely the case. 

What is true, however, is much more sinister than “just” hiding behind civilians.  No – Hamas was hiding UNDER THE ENTIRE CITY OF GAZA. 

Hamas was NOT hiding behind this or that civilian.  They were hiding under EVERY child, EVERY woman, EVERY doctor, EVERY ambulance driver, EVERY journalist.  They hid under EVERY SINGLE innocent person in Gaza. 

With that reality in front of any military – there could only be one outcome.   And that’s the outcome you’ve been watching on TV.

She say what every evangelical says. Those who bless Israel will be blessed. She writes pages and pages of writing in an artistic way. Verses about historical Israel.

At the same time, she listens to people who say that Islam is a religion made by the devil to mislead people from Christianity and Jesus, yet she insists that Muslims are good people. So it goes even deeper.

In the post I presented four claims that I believe to be demonstrably false but ones that are widely accepted by pro-Palestinians as a foundation for my question:

1. The Hamas Ministry of Health provides accurate data when reporting casualties.
2. Israel is indiscriminately bombing Gaza.
3. Israel is overstating Hamas casualties.
4. Hamas is winning (or can't be destroyed) and Israel should accept their generous ceasefire proposal.
5. Palestinian women and children should be prevented from evacuating because allowing them to do so would cause a second Nakba and they would never be able to return to Gaza.

I then asked pro-Palestinians to explain why they would be so opposed to the evacuation of women and children from Gaza if the first four claims are true as an Israeli loss would allow them to return after the war. Naturally they either ignored my question entirely or tried providing non answers to get me to change the subject.

As such I will be using their own arguments against them now in the hopes of provoking an actual response rather than beating around the bush as I had done previously.

To start, I would like to break down the casualty numbers reported by Hamas's Ministry of Health (which pro-Palestinians as well as many news sites like to claim are ""generally accurate"") into something that is a bit more manageable.

As of [Feb 14th](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-129) (yesterday) the Hamas Ministry of Health has claimed 28,473 Palestinian fatalities since Oct 7th. This number includes Palestinians killed by Hamas directly or by rocket misfires that hit civilians in Gaza but for the sake of argument we will pretend that all fatalities were caused by Israel.

While they no longer do so, the ministry had provided the percentage of woman and children fatalities alongside the number of total fatalities. This number was almost consistently at 70% and is the basis for the claim that over 10,000 children were killed by Israel. As I am using pro-Palestinian talking points to form my argument we will initially assume the MoH is not lying that 70% of all fatalities are women and children.

Despite Palestinian women and children occasionally engaging in hostilities and or being members of armed groups, we will use the pro-Palestinian argument that all women and children are innocent civilians. In other words, we will make the assumption that 70% or 19,931.1 of the current fatalities were not members of Hamas.

If 70% of all fatalities are women and children all of whom are innocent civilians that means 30% of the current fatalities (8,541.9) are men.

The Hamas Ministry of Health does not differentiate between civilians and combatants when reporting fatalities so we are forced to make some less than accurate calculations to get the numbers of Hamas members who were killed thus far in the fighting.

Because I couldn't find demographic data that was accurate enough we will once again use a common pro-Palestinian talking point in our calculation. Pro-Palestinians constantly like to remind us that half of Gaza's population consists of children. With a current population of 2.2 million half of that is 1.1 million children. We will then split the remaining 1.1 million in half to determine the number of adult males in Gaza as most countries tend to have a near 50/50 split between men and women in their populations. This gives us 550,000 adult males in Gaza.

Hamas claims to have 40k fighters which assuming none of them are women or children would make up 7.2% of the adult male population in Gaza.

Our next calculation will be based on the claim that Israel is indiscriminately bombing Gaza. One would assume that indiscriminate bombing would result in deaths proportionate to the demographic makeup of an area as fatalities would be random unlike targeted strikes which would skew fatalities more towards combatant deaths. Assuming the bombing of Gaza is indeed indiscriminate we could infer that 7.2% of adult male fatalities are combatants using our previous calculation to determine their share of the population. This would mean (assuming the claims presented by Hamas's ministry of Health are accurate) that 615 of the current fatalities are combatants.

This brings me to point #3. Israel claims to have killed anywhere between 10-11k combatants which (unless the MoH is fabricating data) is impossible considering 100% of adult males in Gaza couldn't be combatants and even if they were, the number of combatants killed would be overstated by at least 1,458.1. Considering women and children are all innocent civilians meaning the number couldn't possibly be taken from their demographic. On top of that, if we accept my calculation which shows only 615 of the fatalities were combatants it means that Israel is overestimating the number of Hamas members killed by 9,385 at the very least.

If Israel is lying, the Hamas Ministry of Health is providing accurate data, and I'm not bad at math, it means the IDF has only managed to kill 615 combatants (or 1.5% of Hamas's fighting force) in the past 130 days since Oct 7th which comes out to 4.7 combatants killed per day. At the current rate it would take Israel approximately 23 years to completely destroy Hamas and its 40k fighters which then leads us to the fourth pro-Palestinian claim that Hamas is winning (or not losing) and that Israel will eventually be forced to accept Hamas's ceasefire proposal as they cannot possibly be defeated militarily.

This brings me to the question that pro-Palestinians refuse to answer because it either forces them to admit that they want Palestinians to die in order to generate hatred against Israel, they want to use Palestinian women and children as human shields, and/or that all pro-Palestinian talking points I have presented until now (especially the casualty numbers provided by the Hamas Ministry of Health) are complete and utter bullshit:

**Why do you oppose the evacuation of women and children from Gaza through Egypt if data provided by the Hamas Ministry of Health shows that the Israeli military will never be able to defeat Hamas, it will be forced to accept a ceasefire to stop its failed assault on Gaza, and couldn't possibly enforce a second ""Nakba"" if Hamas still controls Gaza (and the border) after the war?**

As much as I would like to provide my rebuttals to every possible excuse pro-Palestinians could come up with to justify their answer, I will be forced to do so in a third installment as I have likely reached the character limit for this post and feel it would only be fair to allow them to attempt to debunk any of the claims I have presented thus far (if they can).",Debunking the pro-Palestinian narrative (but more directly this time).,0.65,57,0,2024-02-14 11:48:18

* https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-said-to-believe-israel-killed-just-20-30-of-hamas-terrorists-in-gaza-fighting/

Some other noteworthy points from the article:

* Both Israeli and American intelligence believe that Israel has seriously wounded thousands upon thousands of other Hamas fighters, but while Israel believe most of those wounded will not be able to return to the battlefield, American intelligence believes that most eventually will.

* The US believes that a side in a war losing 25-30% of their troops would normally render their army incapable of functioning/continuing to fight, but because Hamas are essentially guerrilla fighters in a dense urban environment and with access to vast tunnel networks, they can keep it going for several more months.

* The Biden administration is coming more to the position that a total elimination of Hamas would be too difficult in present circumstances, and that Israel should look at crippling their operating capacity as a final war aim rather than a total annihilation. 

* Hamas for their part simply aim to survive the war, and be left standing in any capacity when it is over. Their credibility revolves around being seen by at least the people of Palestine as a legitimate armed resistance capable of sticking it to the “Zionist entity”, and to protect that position and reputation they don’t have to win by any means, but they have to not visibly lose badly or get wiped out. 

What are your thoughts on this? From a military standpoint is it a successful outcome for Israel to date, or is it less than you or Israel would/should have expected? 

How do you think it influences the path forward? Should Israel press ahead with their offensive in the hopes of eliminating more fighters? Or does it prove that Hamas are too resilient to fall completely and now is the time to turn to peace negotiations?

The pro-Israeli position is that we no longer want Hamas near our borders.

The pro-Palestinian side accuses Israel of wanting to take Gaza under permanent control and opposes it.

Both sides talk more about how things shouldn’t be, rather than about how things should be done better. Roughly speaking there are 3 options:

1. Israeli control (with or without Palestinian local government). 
2. Palestinian control - this is a rather vague option from the PA to the return to power of Hamas or the emergence of a new organisation.
3. International (third party) control - from Arab countries to Europe and USA.

I personally prefer the third option. International control will ensure both the security of Israel and the reconstruction of Gaza. But I don't see anyone offering such an option. The first option is bad, but the second could be much worse or at least return us to the status quo before October 7.

According to the Hebrew University poll:

1. 40% of Israelis support Israeli control (22% are in favor of Israeli military rule and 18% leaned toward the idea of Israel annexing Gaza).
2. 11% support Palestinian control (return of the Palestinian Authority).
3. 41% support international control (23% of Israelis support a coalition of moderate Arab states and 18% would like to see an international force).

I think many Israelis would support the third option if it were made more specific.

I'm interested to know opinions. In particular, the views of pro-Palestinians on the third option. If you're against, why? If you support, then why do you think many states and organizations, starting with the UN, concerned about the situation in Gaza, do not offer this option to Israel?

Israel should be moved elsewhere in the world. It is the only possible solution. 

I have heard that originally there were other locations considered for a Jewish nation, lands where it could have actually been ""a land without a people, for a people without a land"". The original Balfour declaration stated that in the creation of the Israeli nation, ""that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine."" Obviously this has not been the case. 

Now I understand that this forum is a platform for Israeli propaganda so I don't expect anything from posting this, I am only stating my opinion. Israel never should have been in Palestine to begin with, and if there was ever a chance it could have existed there in peace, that possibility has been canceled by the insatiable greed and bloodlust and racism of the Israeli settlers, military, media, leadership, and religious authority. 

Commentators who want peace are still talking about a two state solution, but the Palestinians have been too victimized now for there to ever be peace in that region. The two peoples need to be separated, and Israel as the oppressor is the one who needs to leave. I propose to the world that Israel should move it's location elsewhere in the world - making absolutely sure they do not have another local indigenous population to unleash their developed predatory and sadistic tendencies upon.

UPDATE: I am banned, cannot further make responses.

Final thoughts: If Israel is to remain in the region it needs to shrink back to earlier boundaries, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank reconnected, and there needs to be a complete end of occupation of Palestine. 

Look at your own comments, many of you are even supporting the *continued expansion* of Israel, suggesting that the Palestinians should be relocated to make way. Zionists need to stop only thinking of your own history, and consider your affect on others. 

If you need room to expand, Palestine was/is not the place for you. I understand it is not practical for Israel to move locations, but it is also not practical for you to expand into other people's lands. Quit with the double standards.

The issues they have with the palestinians are not exclusively Israel's fault. You can ofc blame the palestinians for their part. I'm sure you can agree that the intifadas were not Israel's fault nor were they good for relations. The extreme violence and acts of terrorism from the palestinians  is a large part of why we are at the point we are.

You can also blame Egypt and Jordan aswell. They were in control of Judea and Samaria along with gaza. They didn't do a thing to help. As much as they hate Israel, they won't do anything for the palestinians because it's a chip they could play when they controlled the area.

These tests help distinguish between those who are earnestly striving for harmony and those whose motivations may be driven by bias or animosity towards Israel.

The classic test asks: ""Did you speak out on any other conflict in the world prior to October 8th?"" This question highlights whether the individual's concerns are rooted in a broader humanitarian perspective or are selectively focused on Israel.  
However, to delve deeper, let's consider more nuanced tests:

**Generational Refugee Status:**

Is the status of being a refugee something that can be inherited across generations? If the answer is yes, why are Jewish refugees from centuries past not given the same recognition as Palestinian refugees? Historically, Jews have faced persecution and displacement, often being refugees in various parts of the world long before the Palestinian issue emerged. Yet, the international community rarely acknowledges Jews as perpetual refugees, many don't say that Jewish people have right to live in Israel.

If the argument is that Jewish people have been in Israel long time ago, but ""too long"", does this imply that Israel should simply keep Palestinians out of Israel long enough for their refugee status to lapse?

**Fighting Terrorism:**

Should terrorism be combated? To what extent should efforts go to fight against terrorist activities? This question addresses the moral and ethical considerations in responding to terrorism. Should the presence of terrorists who fight using dirty methods justify giving up and allowing them free ""out of jail card""? It's crucial to understand that combating terrorism often requires difficult decisions and actions to protect innocent lives and maintain security.

If terrorists employ dirty tactics, does that mean the opposing side should capitulate and allow them to achieve their aims unchallenged?

I know this is pretty controversial and a lot of people including people who lean more pro-Israel may disagree.

1. 80-95 percent of Jews are Zionists so are you saying you only hate 80-95 percent of all Jews and are okay with the other 20-5 percent? 

2. Zionism is defined as- supporting the development and continuation of a Jewish nation (in this case yes Israel since it’s the only Jewish nation) how is this wrong? Imagine there was a word for saying you are for the development and continuation of a Muslim nation let’s just use the word “Islamnationism” now imagine a group emerged called “anti-islamnationists” this would be problematic and most people would consider that group Islamophobic. So why is this not the case when it comes to being anti-Zionist? At this point it’s clear anti-Zionism is a front for anti-semitism. Anti-Zionists as a group may not hold antisemitic views but that doesn’t mean being an anti-Zionist isn’t inherently antisemitic. 

3. You cannot change definitions to fit your narrative. Zionism has a definition and most people who consider themselves Zionists base that belief off of the definition and not the one you have personally given to the word. 

4. I guess my point is while not all anti-Zionists are antisemitic anti-Zionism as a whole is inherently antisemitic since you are basically saying you don’t support the existence of a Jewish nation which would be frowned upon when talking about any other religious group so therefore should be discouraged. Instead of labeling yourself an anti-Zionist maybe consider using anti-Israel although I would disagree with you I wouldn’t consider that belief inherently antisemitic just flawed logically.",Why I believe anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic,0.53,13,0,2024-02-04 04:55:54

In this same way, i don’t believe that anti-Islamism is Islamophobic. I think the problem is that anti-Zionist and anti-Islamist movements invariably do give shelter to Antisemites or Islamophobes. Either accepting them willfully, or ushering them in unwittingly. To say that the entire pro-Palestine movement is purely anti-Zionist, with no trace of antisemitism, you’d have to be brain dead. And vice versa. It’s all in plain view. I think that supporting one side of this conflict 100% with no holds barred requires willful ignorance and self deception. 
This is why I’ll never join a protest movement.

My views on this particular war are probably more in line with the pro-Palestine’s. But you will never find me marching next to some idiot with a Hamas headband. And due to the fact that I am in favor of Israel’s right to exist, I might even be chased out if that were to be revealed. I think this movement isolated themselves, acted recklessly and sensationally, and by doing so, wrecked all chance of support from outside. And Ironically, I can level this exact criticism toward Israel. It’s almost as if they’re using the same playbook.

I think that if most people were honest with themselves, they’d be able to condemn both the October 7th attacks, and Israel’s excessive response. They’d condemn Iran’s role in this war, as well as the US’s. But people would rather lie. I listened to a podcast the other day that was a conversation between a Jew and a Muslim. One of them made an interesting point- People act as if any attempt to recognize each the other side’s pain is to weaken one’s own stance. I’m not saying “let’s all come together and hold hands.” But stop f**** lying. If not to each other, then at least to ourselves.

We can agree that both sides have suffered, both sides have caused pain to the other, and both sides have their extremists who are contributing to this intractable problem. 

I don't want to argue about who is worse. I have my strong opinions about this, but I would rather this not be the focus. The reality is both sides have serious problems that need to be addressed. And we can see that extremism feeds extremism on both sides. We see this globally, in fact.

Right now it is more common to hear the sides defend and absolve themselves while pointing to the atrocities of the other side. I admit that I have been doing this as well, in my attempt to counter the raging anti-Semitism online and in these college protest. 

But ultimately the relentless finger pointing and defensiveness doesn't get us further down a path to peace. So I would like to hear a mature and thoughtful discussion about how both sides can begin to take responsibility for their own contributions to this situation.

Food and cuisine have nothing to do with the conflict. Jews originally were ancient middle eastern levantine semites more similar to phoenicians and canaanites and the reason we all think jews are white european from europe is because due to jewish exile jews went to other places and adopted the local culture and mixed with the locals and the jews who founded modern day political zionism were Ashkenazi jews of German central and eastern europe. That why jews from europe dont look like levantine people with olive complexion due to living there for so long. And most people who arent aware of the diversity of the jewish people all think jews are white european ashkenazi jews who eat bagels and matzah ball soup and speak yiddish which is a germanic lanaguge. 

If you look at Israel most of israel is not white ashkenazi and the majority of isreal jews are non white non ashkenazi jews like mizrahim from the middle eats and sefradim who are jews form spain. It wrong to assume all of isreal is white european looking ashkenazi. The reason you think most jews are like that is because you grew up in the west or grew up where you never meet a jew and most of the jewish culture you see is ashkenazim as that is the most portrayed in america and most of israel elite and founders of modern day zionism were ashkenazim.

And for the people who think jews steal culture and appropriate the food if i asked you what jews are supposed to eat are you basically saying that jews cant claim the cultural heritage of the Levant and have to eat their ashkenazi food. Do you think jews are supposed to eat just bagels with cream cheese and salmon and matzah ball soup. If that the case then what did ancient Jewish people in biblical times eat did Jews eat the same middle eastern food that Palestinians eat today or did they not eat the same foods.

IMO I believe jews have a right claim these cuisines as their own as it is a part of the broader levatine middle eastern heritage. And many of the same countries claim the same dishes as their own and yet you dont see pushback saying muh lebanese appropriated shwarma from palestinians or muh syrian appropriated hummus from lebanese. If anything when white ashkenazi Jews start eating levatine palestinian middle eastern food that is a good thing as jews are reclaiming their semitic levatine heritage and in time will abandon their germano slavic influenced culture for a more semitic levantine arab one.",When people say that Israelis steal Arab food and appropriate it that simply is not true. ,0.59,25,0,2024-11-24 05:21:27

What would stop Israel from actually taking over all the land. The only reason they haven’t is because of public opinion but if the public opinion of Israel is based off of lies and it’s already low, why wouldn’t they say it can’t get worse. 

They can’t charge Israel with genocide once and then turn around and say ok it wasn’t real the first time but now they actually are committing genocide…

The pro-Israeli position is that we no longer want Hamas near our borders.

The pro-Palestinian side accuses Israel of wanting to take Gaza under permanent control and opposes it.

Both sides talk more about how things shouldn’t be, rather than about how things should be done better. Roughly speaking there are 3 options:

1. Israeli control (with or without Palestinian local government). 
2. Palestinian control - this is a rather vague option from the PA to the return to power of Hamas or the emergence of a new organisation.
3. International (third party) control - from Arab countries to Europe and USA.

I personally prefer the third option. International control will ensure both the security of Israel and the reconstruction of Gaza. But I don't see anyone offering such an option. The first option is bad, but the second could be much worse or at least return us to the status quo before October 7.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/majority-of-israelis-oppose-annexation-resettlement-of-gaza-poll/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/majority-of-israelis-oppose-annexation-resettlement-of-gaza-poll/)

According to the Hebrew University poll:

1. 40% of Israelis support Israeli control (22% are in favor of Israeli military rule and 18% leaned toward the idea of Israel annexing Gaza).
2. 11% support Palestinian control (return of the Palestinian Authority).
3. 41% support international control (23% of Israelis support a coalition of moderate Arab states and 18% would like to see an international force).

I think many Israelis would support the third option if it were made more specific.

I'm interested to know opinions. In particular, the views of pro-Palestinians on the third option. If you're against, why? If you support, then why do you think many states and organizations, starting with the UN, concerned about the situation in Gaza, do not offer this option to Israel?

So instead, why not make a gun pod with a cut down M2 (you don’t need a tripod on a plane) placed into an aerodynamic pod(literally just the entire gun assembly placed into it to reduce spare parts deviance)? Alternatively , if that is too heavy/cumbersome, just do the same instead with an M240G as there is no need for a heat cover while on an aircraft.

Furthermore, give the pod the capability for about 10 degrees of pivot and maybe auto targeting to be enabled at the pilot’s discretion (eg. fire on all hostile radar blips) so as to reduce pilot micromanagement, as they already have much to deal with in regards to their machines.

I know the US already has some concrete suggestions for reducing casualties but I'm wondering why the no one is suggesting the following plan. Seem like it could avoid both civilian casualties and Israeli troop losses.\
Now that north Gaza is evacuated send in Israeli troops to destroy the tunnels and setup a good security solution. With modern surveillance and drone technology you should be able to automate a lot of the grunt work of occupation. Setup a security checkpoint at the boundary between north and south Gaza. Then bring people from south Gaza to north Gaza while checking them for weapons. Once south Gaza is evacuated destroy the tunnels in South Gaza and setup security in south gaza.\
  

It seems to me that  the current strategy of warning before bombing can't work because hamas militants will also get that warning and leave. Also, they told civilians to go to south gaza and then bombed south gaza anyways [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html).
This is not the point of my post but for context the US has suggested:  
- use smaller bombs  
- gather more intelligence before bombing  
- use commandos  
\
One counter argument I can think of is that this does not involve killing any hamas millitants.Just destroying tunnels, setting up security infrastructure, and taking over governance. But even if you did kill all the Hamas militants more would come. The current strategy isn't very good at killing hamas millitants anyways. So far they have killed 7000 out of 30000 hamas fighters. [https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-bombs-destruction-death-toll-scope-419488c511f83c85baea22458472a796#:\~:text=Eleven%20weeks%20into%20the%20war,way%20to%20free%20more%20hostages](https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-bombs-destruction-death-toll-scope-419488c511f83c85baea22458472a796#:~:text=Eleven%20weeks%20into%20the%20war,way%20to%20free%20more%20hostages). At that rate they'd kill 85000 civilians to finish.Some might think transportation is an issue but walking from Khan Yunis to Jabalia takes 6 hours.

Some would argue that Israel can deter future attacks by killing more civilians but this is immoral and would probably not work.

Update:
Based on the comments I now realize that no one is suggesting this because there are no centrists looking for better solutions. There are only people who want ceasefire and people who can't hear any critique Israeli policy.

A core point of disagreement is how quickly more gazans would become terrorists. Also how many hamas fighters are undercover as civilians and not currently fighting so that no intelligence could reveal them. I'm not sure but maybe a lot less with my plan which would minimize civilian casualties!

Another common point is that this plan would take too long but you have to do all these steps at some point anyways.

Some say this would put Israeli troops in danger. Yes but not much more than what the danger the had at checkpoints everyday before Oct 7.

Collective Punishment**: You will hear many pro Palestine say they’re against collective punishment and that's why they’re protesting against the Israeli government for collectively punishing “innocent” Palestinians civilians because of Hamas. But then, they turn around and protest outside synagogues, harass Jewish people just for wearing a magon David, block Jewish students from getting into their own campus, vandalize Jewish-owned businesses, and spam ""free Palestine"" on content by Jewish creators. Isn’t that's the exact same kind of collective punishment they’re against?

**2. The Blame Game**: I see a lot of pro-Palestine people blaming Israel for just about everything. They expect Israel to do everything for Palestinians, even though Hamas and the PLO should be responsible of taking care of their own people. The Israeli government spends millions on defense, including bomb shelters in people’s homes, which aren't free. Instead of Hamas or the PLO doing the same, they don’t. Hamas choose to build tunnels to hide in and steals humanitarian aid, then sells it at crazy prices instead of helping their people. Not only that but Hamas leaders live in luxurious houses in Qatar while Palestinians are living in poverty in cramped apartments. Hamas and the PLO have the ability to help their people but choose to spend money on themselves. 

Egypt and Gulf countries also have the ability to help Palestinians, but they don’t. Egypt has closed its border and it’s even now constructing a bigger border to prevent Palestinian from entering into the country. Gulf countries have the money to house and take care of Palestinians, but they refuse to let them into their countries. Yet there has been little to no condemnation of these Arab nations. 

When no Arab countries step up to help Palestine and when groups like Hamas and the PLO don't even help their own people, it becomes Israel's problem. Israel is then expected to provide food, shelter, water, and electricity to the same people who livestreamed a massacre of 1200 Israelis (Palestinians.) And if Israel doesn't take actions to protect and take care of Palestinians, Israel gets criticized and blamed when Palestinians end up having a low quality of life or dealing with the aftermath of a war they initiated.

Since 1950, the U.S. has given over 11 billion dollars in aid to Palestine but the country hasn’t seen much development because instead of using the money to build a military, create bomb shelters, or just improve the country, a lot of it has been used by Hamas to fund terrorist activities.

Then pro-Palestine expect Israel to go easy on Palestinians and not retaliate because they don’t have the power to defend themselves, and when Israel ignores this and decides to defend itself from these terrorist attacks, Israel is accused of committing genocide. How is it genuinely fair to hold Israel accountable for the living conditions in Palestine and ALL the civilians deaths? Why isn't Hamas held accountable, even though they've had a huge role in preventing development and causing many Palestinian deaths in this ongoing war? The logic doesn’t add up. 

**3. Self Defense:**  I often hear pro-Palestine supporters say that resistance is okay, and that Palestinians have the right to resist. I totally agree—everyone has the right to defend themselves. But my question is: why is it that when Israel defends itself against terrorists, it is greatly condemned and scrutinized? Hamas can kidnap, rape, and intentionally target Israeli civilians, and still claim it's their right to defend themselves. Since October 8th, Hezbollah has been attacking northern Israel, there has been forest fires and people have been forced to evacuate their homes. I’ve seen some pro-Palestine supporters get excited and cheer for these attacks, just like they did on October 7th when innocent Israeli civilians, including children, were being raped, tortured, and killed. Iran has fired over 350 missiles into Israeli cities under the banner of ""self-defense and resistance."" But when Israel responds with overwhelming force to protect its citizens, people start yelling ""genocide."" Currently, Hezbollah is escalating its attacks on northern Israel. When they eventually face the consequences of their actions, don't attempt to twist it to make Israel look worse than those committing atrocities. 

 To be clear, I’m not wishing for any misfortune that may come to Lebanon—I know the Lebanese people will greatly suffer from the war that is upcoming, and that's never a good thing. But I just want to ask those pro Palestines who say ""resistance is okay"": who gets to resist? Is it only Hamas and Palestinians? Can Israel not defend itself violently in a war against a terror group that just broke its borders? If pro-Palestine supporters truly believe in resistance, then they shouldn't pick and choose who has that right. The stance on self-defense and resistance has been inconsistent from the pro-Palestine side. To them it’s okay for Hamas to attack and kill Israeli civilians but not okay for Israel to defend itself and do the same. That's a major problem I see with pro-Palestine. 

Pro-Israel supporters will condemn the Israeli government when necessary but you rarely see pro-Palestine supporters condemning Hamas. Resistance seems to be acceptable for everyone except Jews. Should Israel just sit by and watch as Hamas and other terrorist groups attack, rape, and abuse Israelis civilians?

This is just my Issues with Pro-Palestine Supporters and the way they think. For the past 75 years, Palestinian militants have consistently tried to kill Jews. Despite what you might believe, Palestinians aren’t some poor oppressed victims, they have been trying to eliminate Israel for almost a century. But the moment Israel defends itself, suddenly we're accused of committing genocide?

If pro-Palestine truly care about Palestinians, then why do they collectively punish Jewish people, especially Jews living abroad who have nothing to do with what's happening in Israel and Gaza? Why vandalize Jewish businesses or mark Jewish houses with the Star of David? Why target Jewish schools? Why bring up the fact that some Jews come from Poland, Germany, or other European countries to deny their identity and portray them as white European colonizers? Anyone with common sense shouldn’t even care about that. And if you do care, you should do some research, but most pro-Palestine supporters don’t because they aren’t interested in educating themselves. The truth is, none of this has anything to do with Palestine.

And why use the Holocaust as a comparison to what's happening in Palestine or vandalize Holocaust monuments? The two situations aren’t even comparable. Yes, the situation in Palestine is terrible but the way some pro-Palestine supporters advocate comes off as deeply rooted in anti-Jewish sentiment. I’ve seen many of them try to minimize the suffering of Holocaust survivors by saying what Palestinians are going through is worse and I find that absurd. I firmly believe nobody needs to use the Holocaust in order for people to understand the gravity of what’s happening in Palestine. 

Do pro-Palestine not see how much they’re actively hurting their own activism and goals with these actions? Instead of focusing on helping Palestine, many pro-Palestine supporters spend more time harassing Jews online and attacking Jews for simply existing. I genuinely don’t see how this helps people in Palestine. To be completely honest, it doesn’t seem like this was ever about freeing Palestine. It feels like people are just using this movement as a cover to be anti-Israel and anti-Jewish. 

Many people would agree especially given the rise in antisemitism. If this was truly about the liberation of Palestinian people, we wouldn’t see such a noticeable rise in antisemitism.

Hundreds of protesters blocked Tel Aviv’s main highway late on Friday in a spontaneous demonstration calling for the return of the other hostages.

They later vented their anger outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, where the three-pronged Israeli war cabinet meets to discuss the offensive operation in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defence minister Yoav Gallant and former Chief of the General Staff and opposition leader Benny Gantz make up the cabinet.

The protestors carried placards and candles, and chanted “today we learned what happens when there is no deal”, according to footage of the event.


An initial IDF probe into the hostage-killing incident suggests all three men were shirtless, with one carrying a makeshift white flag. On seeing them, one Israeli soldier shouted “terrorists!” to the other forces, initiating fire at the men, according to reports. While two hostages were hit immediately and fell to the ground, the third managed to escape into a nearby building where despite pleas in Hebrew, he was also shot and killed, a military official said.

A soldier saw the hostages emerging tens of metres from Israeli forces in the area of Shejaiya, the official said. “They’re all without shirts and they have a stick with a white cloth on it. The soldier feels threatened and opens fire. He declares that they’re terrorists, they (forces) open fire, two are killed immediately,” said the military official. The third hostage was wounded and retreated into a nearby building where he called for help in Hebrew, the official said. “Immediately the battalion commander issues a ceasefire order, but again there’s another burst of fire towards the third figure and he also dies,” said the official. “This was against our rules of engagement,” he added.",What are your thoughts on the protest in Tel Aviv over the hostages murdered by IDF?,0.81,106,0,2023-12-16 13:12:55

Since 2001, Gaza has terrorised Isrealis.  They have fired tens of thousands of rockets at civilians.  They have carried out dozens of terrorist attacks. 

Isreal responded with check points, military operations, and a blockade, and Palestinians cry that they are oppressed.  What did they expect would happen? 

Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th to provoke them to attack Gaza.  They fire rockets from civilian infrastructure.  This is what we mean by human shields.  Hamas doesn't care about Palestinians.  

Isreali lives are not 'worth more' than Palestinians' ones.  Isreal just wants the attacks to stop. 

It's unfortunate that so many people had to die, and maybe Isreal could have done things differently.  But so far, all the defensive measures they have put in place to protect their citizens have failed.

There is no future for Palestine, it is a failed state.  They are incapable of governing themselves and living peacefully next to Israel. 

They are also incapable of living amongst the Jews, this is why the two-state solution was proposed in the first place. 

Unfortunately, Jordan and Egypt don't want to take them back either.  So I honestly don't know what the solution is.  But one thing is certain, Hamas must be dismantled, and Palestinians have to stop attacking Israel.

Turkish airstrikes on infrastructure in northeast Syria have left over a million people without access to reliable water and electricity, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis fueled by years of war and extreme drought. The strikes have targeted power stations crucial for water access, forcing residents to rely on limited tanker deliveries, which are insufficient to meet the demand. Experts warn that such actions could violate international humanitarian law by targeting essential civilian infrastructure.

&gt;“Water is more precious than gold here,” said Ahmad al-Ahmed, a tanker driver. “People need more water. All they want is for you to give them water.”

One is very recent past where greater Serbia aspirations and Greater Croatia aspirations exactly wanted that, to split Bosnia amongst each other but the way they wanted to do it was genocidal against Bosniaks right from the start and they used force to force expell, starve and genocide whole Bosnian regions in a very ideological manner that bordered nazism(for ex. In Prijedor  surviving Bosniaks within city were forced to wear white stripes around their arms just like nazis forced jews to wear same ones.)
 
Another notable reason is cause both of those ethnicities lived in Bosnia for thousands of years and now to destroy Bosnias history and identity for the sake of feeding off the ultranationalistic apetites of neighboring countries?

Another reason is that many towns, cities and settlements within Bosnia are of very mixed ethnic demographics, one of them is Mostar, another one is Srebrenica (which was majority Bosniak prior to war but due to genocide its mixed now). Just to illustrate: from 930.000 population in Serbian  majority entity in Bosnia about 150.000 - 160.000 are Bosniaks which is significant, prior to the war it was 450.000 Bosniaks.

TLDR: Israel is the only pro lgbt country in the region with the largest pride parade and Palestine is at the bottom of the lgbt equality index. Why do so many gay and bisexual people still support Palestine over Israel? 

I added some links if people are curious to learn more about how Palestinians are treated in the West Bank and Gaza:

yep, america's percentage of their weapons stock is not that high.

So defense contractors can keep americans in good jobs, knowing there is an order coming from Israel every year.

It took holocaust denial for people to condemn her. I’ve seen celebrities getting called out and getting shit for their pro Israel positions (any shumer, Noah schapp) or people like Lana del ray for wanting the hostages released yet celebrities who are pro Hamas (Mia Khalifa, Amanda Seeles) or anti semitism from John Crusack, Macklemore don’t get a peep from pro Palestine people but things pro Israel people have said get put out there and if you criticize anti semitic YouTube streamers or other people I see tweets telling people to leave them alone. 

The pro Palestine movement can be thriving but they don’t elevate Palestinian peace activists or Israelis that want peace but instead choose to let anti semitism slide in their movement without distancing themselves from the radicals and wonder why the anti semitism charges get used a lot.

Those who support Israel will also feel anxiety about a potential violent destruction of Israel - or an Israel which collapses because of its own internal chaos.

The history of the land which now makes up Israel/Palestine is a history of nations and kingdoms rising and falling,  many who controlled this land thought they would be the ones to control it forever - until they didn't. So the feeling of the state of Israel being inevitably prone to destruction is understandable, Israelis themselves seem obsessed with their own destruction.

But personally despite all of this, I'm not sure if it's that easy for Israel to cease to exist. Countries are simply not really that easy to destroy and previous attempts to destroy Israel have failed. Its true it is riveted by very serious and intense political divisions which seem to be only getting worse - but I'm not sure if this necessarily means there will no longer be no state of Israel, just a different one.

Having said this I would not rule out the idea of Israel ceasing to exist as a state completely as history has shown that the previously unthinkable can suddenly just happen - Israel's creation was an example of such a moment and maybe its end will be too

It's NOT anti-semitism to pass crticisim on Israel
It's NOT anti-semtisim to ask Israel to stop settlements.

The problem is that you are all VERY aggressive about this issue, even though it's scale is much smaller than other issues that you were all pretty much silent about, and most of you can't even explain why you are pro-Palestine 

To elaborate, on every single post from the pro-Palestine side, there are people in the comments from either Israels side, or people who are relatively neutral engaging. Agreeing, disagreeing, and explaining why.

On the other hand, on pro-israeli/anti-hamas/posts crticising pro-palestinians, there are barely any pro-palestiniand engaing with the arguements being made. Those who do engage, usually make points that were already countered in the post, and then don't respond when the person who made the post or other people responding to them.

The problem isn't that you're crticising Israel, it's that you are biased against it, and can't explain why you're right.

A concrete example:
The genocide arguement. You are all justfying everything you say, by saying Israel is commiting genocide. 

Yet for some reason, on posts explaining why it isn't a genocide, I haven't seen a single person manage to actually refute what the posts are saying, but rather some people saying ""yes it is"".

If you want I'll add images of the specific messages I'm talking about

I personally wouldn’t want to live in Gaza if I was Gazan, nor would I want my family to go back there. But why does it seem like Saudi Arabia and other Arab leaders are now taking the strongest stances they have ever taken? There were responses before condemning Israel but seriously all the killing of children in hospitals didn’t do it? The idea of moving them to other countries in the Middle East was the big red line? Not all the killing and torture and starvation? No one would want to go back to Gaza. It’s just rubble, it’s even worse than a wasteland because there is concrete falling and obviously the threat of another conflict ensuing which would make it even more dangerous. All of a sudden Saudi Arabia and King Abdullah are taking the strongest stance they have ever had and opposing Israel in ways we have not seen before. Moving Gazans out of Gaza to other middle eastern countries is better than living in a warzone that won’t end. I am Jordanian and know of many Palestinians in Jordan who had amazing lives, they were professors doctors etc. Why should the people of Gaza not have the same opportunity that Palestinians around the world have?

Transcript:

""Any human being right now has to be distressed by what is happening in Gaza, because of the quantity of innocent deaths. I would just like some of the protests to mention Hamas because that's where this started.

And Hamas is a terrorist organization, you know. And it's very strange for young, progressive student politics, to kind of support a fascist terrorist group. You know, because, you know, they're talking about ""free Palestine.""

I mean, I'm somebody who has argued for a Palestinian State for most of my life, since the 1980s, probably. 

Right now, if there was a Palestinian State, it would be run by Hamas. And that would make it a Taliban-like state.  You know, and it would be a client state of Iran. 

And is that what the progressive movements of the Western left wish to create? To have another Taliban? To have another ayatollah-like state, in the Middle East, right next to Israel? 

So, I feel that there's not a lot of deep thought happening, you know. There's an emotional reaction to the death in Gaza. And that's absolutely right. But when it slides over towards antisemitism and sometimes actual support of Hamas, then it's very problematic.""

He has a pretty unique lens on this whole situation after being under a flatwa for so many years for simply writing a book. 

From like 1989 to 1999 the dude had around the clock security provided by the UK and was mostly in hiding. 

Apparently the fatwa was lifted around the year 2000 and then he sort of started reemerging and going on interviews and this sort of thing and was even on Curb famously. 

Unfortunately fate caught up to him and in 2022 he was stabbed in the face and lost his eye and also the use of his hand. 60 minutes actually has a pretty good interview with him that you can find on YouTube.

He really echoes what I think a lot of us are scratching our heads at where we both understand where a lot of pro Palestinian people are coming from but then we are confused because they aren't being very open about denouncing Hamas. 

In fact just from the footage I've seen from many encampments I don't think I've actually seen a single person directly condemn Hamas a  October 7th.

I've seen a fair amount of comments on Reddit that denounce Hamas and then a few on Facebook that are still leaning pro Palestine but it's pretty quiet out there otherwise.

**Brief summary of the article:**

  
Wharton prof finds statistical anomalies in Gaza death toll numbers suggesting that they statistically can't be accurate.

1. The daily reported deaths all fall within 270+/-15%, which is statistically impossible. There should be much more variation in daily death numbers. The Hamas numbers suggest that almost the same number of people are being killed every single day.
2. There is almost no correlation between the number of deaths among women and children reported each day, which makes no sense. The lack of correlation would imply that women and children are largely separated in Gaza so that IDF strikes are killing them independently.
3. There is a strong *negative* correlation between reported deaths of men and women. While this might make some sense in that combatant men should be separated from women, the correlation is much stronger than it should be. On days when reported deaths of men were almost zero (which suggests a reporting error), the number of women killed were among their highest.
4. Hamas claims that 6000 fighters have been killed, which when combined with their reported deaths of women and children would imply that either very few non-combatant men are being killed or that almost all of the men in Gaza are Hamas fighters.

""Most likely, the Hamas ministry settled on a daily total arbitrarily,"" he concludes.

What's interesting is that this story literally didn't make the mainstream news in the West. Almost like Western media doesn't think it's important that Hamas is fabricating their death toll numbers, despite the fact that these numbers are being referred to daily as evidence for the ""Gaza genocide"" and the need for a ceasefire.",More evidence that the Hamas death toll numbers are garbage,0.78,274,0,2024-03-14 14:22:32

I only stated that rasul Allah ""*A 50 year old who's supposed to be the model for everyone to follow for ALL time*.""

Do you disagree with that statement?  (Quran 3:31–32, &amp; 33:21). Everything else is taken directly from the Sunnah

&gt;so i just have one question to close out with does this information that you have presented give you the right to harm me or my family in any way?

This is a work of fiction from your imagination; can you show me where I stated anything of the sort?

So, the topic still stands, how do you reconcile what I quoted above with your statement?

&gt;&gt;but my question that really bugs me is who decided that western civilization and religion is better than my own civilization and religion?",IsraelPalestine,2025-02-24 01:09:47,1iwod1g,Diet-Bebsi,0,5,0,True,2023-12-14 16:37:42,0.0,0.0,1.0,8681.0,8682.0,0,"now this topic might be a little touchy but i will go through with it anyway. but as i have spent the last bit of a year and a half on this subreddit i have found a startling pattern that i noticed way back then when i started to look through its comments and posts. 

and the thing that i would find among the posts about hamas and israel and whatnot is that alot of people will simply chalk it up to the Palestinians being majority muslim and as a result act ""Barbarically and savagely"" 

and that, the reason why i should not support them is because well ""Islam is a backwards religion that is based purely on mysticism and desert pagan gods"" i heard from one redditor. now this set me back why? because i myself am a Muslim from the united states, and throughout my time here i have had more than 20 years to soak in the western neo liberal hospitality and try to understand as to what makes my religion or culture ""inferior"" in relation to ""superior"" western ideals and doctrine. 

now i got alot of people who came out with different evidences on this matter such as the technological developments of the west, and the democracy of the west and the relative peace that the west affords due to these principles and position. and that the east and especially muslim civilization is backwards due to not having invented any meaningful technology and not making any significant contributions to science or development of serious projects that have actively benefited humanity as a whole. 

now why do i bring up the ""clash of civilizations argument"" when i am talking about peoples position on Palestine? because like i said the reason that i have seen from some people as a legitimate reason as to why palestine is the way it is today and why people should be against it is the same argument that people use when trying to shape the ""clash of civilizations argument"" to me. 

the reason why i find this a weak form of argument because this could be said about any group of people at anytime prior to the 21st centruy when western civilization was leagues above everyone else and had no one to challenge it such as china, india, Indonesia, africa, and south america being stark parallels to the middle east and ""muslim civilization in terms of development in the time prior to the 21st century. 

then i started to see a bigger picture that this argument is nothing but an egotistical fever dream of neoliberals in there position to feel as thought that western civilization is better simply due to time or position. and that this argument has been used before to enslave africans, and kill the native americans, and to go after the gypsies of europe.

what it is in sense is a superiority complex to justify the crule treatment of people that the west has bombed and murdered, like saying that ""black people are inherently more likely to commit crime"" what does this do this puts in peoples mind that black people are inferior to white people due to there propensity to commit crime when in real life i have yet to find a black person that has robbed me or treated me badly. 

in fact this superiority complex was used to the fullest extent in south africa and Rhodesia in order to infantize black people and treat them less by saying that they could not do things without a white man in charge.  

the US used this position in iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam also in an effort to subject and pacify the population to be able to take advantage of them. 

but my question that really bugs me is who decided that western civilization and religion is better than my own civilization and religion? and why do they need to rub it in on me? if there civilizations and religion is so great wouldn't i have been convinced on my own?

thats when i realized that this was never about convincing people like me or letting people like me see the light of the west. no this was about subjection my mind and pacifying my position so that way i couldn't challenge there superiority and part of that convincing was making me leave my religion to become agnostic and also so that way i could have a higher sense of belonging with western ideals. 

when i started seeing people say such hateful things about islam and talking about how it told us to kill jews and to destroy the none believers i realized that i had been conned and that these people were lying to me about my own religion. 

i asked myself why would they do this to me? and soon when the war in gaza happened i had friends who had no sympathy for any of the palestinians and i asked them why wouldn't you want them to live what did they do to you?  then they told me that:

 ""its because they are Muslim savages, they're book tells them to kill jews and there treatment of women is almost borderline abuse, they deserve everything they get and more.""

then i asked ""what about me im i like that to you?""

then they said"" of course not your one of the GOOD ONES"".

this was the final nail in the coffin when i realized that this society didnt care about me and didnt see me as human, they simply wanted to utilize me to discredit my own religion, and have a scapegoat of an uncle tom to say that i am what a GOOD MUSLIM should be. 

this is when i lost all faith in this society, who are you to say you are superior to me when we breath the same air and eat the same food and drink the same water. my ancestors are from egypt, a place which started farming way before any other group of people does that make me better than any of you? 

absolutely not so through all of this analysis and thinking i came to the conclusion that the hatred towards Palestinians is purely based off of a ""clash between civilizations"" pov and not from a legitimate stance of wanting to help them because if that was the case then the entire western world wouldn't have thrown away its moral position in order to let them die, they would have tried harder to reeducate them and make them see the error of there ways but unfortunately the west is so stuck in its position of superiority that it wishes to resort to treating them like animals because they are ""dangerous bloodthirsty savages"".

thank you to all the people that attacked and belittled my religion over the years truly because had you not i would not be pro Palestinian and i would not have been a Muslim to this day.  

ironically it was hate driven by superiority that pushed me back towards my religion and not against it, and i will thank all of those people for the rest of my life.

Everyone was talking about the Gaza death toll from the Israel-Hamas war, and one of the pro-Palestinians said that the Gaza health ministry has been historically accurate with its numbers. Like when third-party organizations come in to count the deaths themselves, their numbers match the health ministry's toll. The host Nick then argued that this was the case because the health ministry would slash the death toll at the last minute, and then give that new refined number for verification, so they could then say their number was accurate.

He also claimed that the Gaza Ministry would shift the people's ages to make them appear younger. Like 18-year-olds one month would appear to be 17 another month and so on to make it look like Israel is killing so many minors.

I was wondering about the accuracy of the host's claims. Like is the ""Hamas-run"" health ministry really as unreliable like he claims? I'm trying to research this and have a hard time verifying any of this yet.

I always thought the death toll numbers were accurate based on some research I've done so far. For example, here's one report from the Lancet stating that there's no evidence they inflate numbers:

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02713-7/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02713-7/fulltext)

These claims from the host are so new to me.

I'm eager to hear everyone's thoughts!

If anyone has seen Nick's lives on tiktok, I would also love to hear your opinion about them. His lives keep showing up on my fyp.

  
EDIT: I'll give the example the host gave to explain how GHM slashes the death toll: 

The GHM would report 10k people dead from a war. Third-party orgs will ask to verify this themselves, and right before they check, the GHM would then slash their death toll to a realistic 6k last minute. that last-minute 6k death toll would be used in comparison to third-party numbers which would also verify its 6k. So essentially, with the GHM's toll and third-party toll matching, the GHM can say their numbers are accurate. These are hypothetical numbers, but I hope this example clarifies things.

The state of Israel was proclaimed on May 14, 1948, by the Jewish leadership in Palestine, led by David Ben-Gurion. This was done without the approval of the United Nations Security Council, which had the authority to decide on the future of the former British Mandate of Palestine. The declaration of independence was based on the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, which recommended the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with an international regime for Jerusalem. However, this resolution was rejected by the Arab states and the Palestinian Arabs, who launched a war against the Jewish state. The declaration of independence also followed the withdrawal of the British forces from Palestine, which ended the mandate on May 15, 1948. The declaration of independence was recognized by several countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union, but it also faced opposition and hostility from other countries, especially the Arab and Muslim world.

## Background

The question of Palestine was brought to the United Nations in 1947, after the British government announced its intention to terminate its mandate and requested the UN to find a solution. The UN established a special committee (UNSCOP) to investigate the situation and propose a plan. UNSCOP visited Palestine and heard testimonies from various parties, including the Jewish Agency, the Arab Higher Committee, and the British administration. UNSCOP issued its report on September 3, 1947, which proposed two main options: a federal state or a partition. The majority of the committee members supported the partition plan, which allocated 56.47% of the land to the Jewish state and 43.53% to the Arab state, with Jerusalem and its surroundings under international control. The minority of the committee members supported the federal state plan, which envisaged a single state with two autonomous provinces, one Jewish and one Arab, and a central government.

The partition plan was submitted to the General Assembly, which debated it for several weeks. The plan faced strong opposition from the Arab states, which argued that it violated the rights of the Palestinian Arabs, who constituted the majority of the population and owned most of the land. The plan also faced criticism from some Jewish groups, which claimed that it did not provide enough security and territory for the Jewish state. The plan was supported by the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries, which saw it as a compromise and a way to end the conflict and violence in Palestine. The plan was also endorsed by the Jewish Agency, which represented the Zionist movement and the Jewish community in Palestine. The Jewish Agency accepted the plan as a basis for negotiation, but reserved the right to modify it in accordance with the realities on the ground.

The General Assembly voted on the partition plan on November 29, 1947. The plan was approved by 33 votes in favor, 13 votes against, and 10 abstentions. The Arab states and the Palestinian Arabs rejected the plan and declared that they would resist it by all means. The Jewish Agency and the Jewish community in Palestine welcomed the plan and celebrated it as a historic achievement. The British government announced that it would abide by the decision of the UN, but it also stated that it would not assist in the implementation of the plan or the establishment of the states. The British government also declared that it would withdraw its forces from Palestine by May 15, 1948, and that it would hand over the responsibility for the administration of the country to the UN.

## The trusteeship proposal

The partition plan was supposed to be implemented by the UN through a transitional period, during which a commission would be appointed to assist the two states in preparing for their independence. However, the implementation of the plan was hampered by several obstacles, such as the lack of cooperation from the British authorities, the outbreak of violence between the Jews and the Arabs, and the reluctance of some members of the Security Council to endorse the plan. The Security Council was the organ of the UN that had the power to enforce the decisions of the General Assembly and to maintain international peace and security. However, the Security Council was divided on the issue of Palestine, and some of its permanent members, such as Britain and France, had their own interests and agendas in the region.

In February 1948, the United States, which was the main sponsor of the partition plan, changed its position and proposed a new plan, which involved placing Palestine under a temporary UN trusteeship. The trusteeship system was a mechanism of the UN that aimed to administer and supervise the territories that were not yet ready for self-government or independence. The trusteeship proposal was motivated by several factors, such as the concern for the safety of the Jews in Palestine, the fear of a wider war in the Middle East, and the pressure from the Arab states and the British government. The US hoped that the trusteeship would provide a period of calm and stability, during which the parties could negotiate a peaceful settlement. The US also hoped that the trusteeship would prevent the Soviet Union from gaining influence and access in the region.

The trusteeship proposal was presented to the Security Council on March 19, 1948, by the US representative, Warren Austin. The proposal suggested that the General Assembly should suspend the partition plan and convene a special session to consider the establishment of a trusteeship for Palestine. The proposal also suggested that the Security Council should request the consent of the parties concerned, namely the Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee, for the trusteeship. The proposal also suggested that the Security Council should authorize the appointment of a mediator, who would facilitate the negotiations between the parties and the UN.

The trusteeship proposal was met with mixed reactions from the different parties. The Arab states and the Palestinian Arabs welcomed the proposal, as they saw it as a chance to reverse the partition plan and to achieve their goal of a unitary Arab state in Palestine. The British government also supported the proposal, as it saw it as a way to avoid the responsibility and the blame for the situation in Palestine. The Soviet Union and its allies opposed the proposal, as they saw it as a betrayal of the partition plan and a violation of the rights of the Jews. The Jewish Agency and the Jewish community in Palestine rejected the proposal, as they saw it as a threat to their aspirations for independence and statehood. The Jewish Agency also argued that the proposal was illegal and impractical, as it contradicted the decision of the General Assembly and ignored the realities on the ground.

## The declaration of independence

The trusteeship proposal was discussed and debated in the Security Council and the General Assembly, but it failed to gain the necessary support and approval. The Security Council did not adopt the proposal, as it faced vetoes from the Soviet Union and its allies. The General Assembly did not convene a special session, as it did not receive the consent of the parties concerned. The Security Council did appoint a mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden, who arrived in Palestine in May 1948, but he did not manage to persuade the parties to accept the trusteeship or any other solution.

Meanwhile, the situation in Palestine deteriorated, as the violence and the clashes between the Jews and the Arabs escalated. The Jewish forces, organized under the Haganah, the main military wing of the Jewish Agency, managed to gain the upper hand in the fighting, and to secure most of the territory allocated to the Jewish state by the partition plan. The Arab forces, composed of the local militias and the volunteers from the neighboring countries, failed to prevent the Jewish advances, and suffered heavy losses and defeats. The British forces, which were supposed to maintain law and order, did not intervene in the conflict, and continued their withdrawal from Palestine.

As the date of the end of the British mandate approached, the Jewish leadership in Palestine faced a crucial decision: whether to declare the independence of the Jewish state, or to wait for the outcome of the UN deliberations. The Jewish leadership, headed by David Ben-Gurion, the chairman of the Jewish Agency and the leader of the Zionist movement, decided to declare the independence of the Jewish state, despite the risks and the challenges. The Jewish leadership based its decision on several considerations, such as the following:

- The Jewish leadership believed that the partition plan was still valid and binding, and that it gave the Jews the right and the duty to establish their own state in Palestine.

- The Jewish leadership believed that the trusteeship proposal was dead and buried, and that it had no chance of being implemented or accepted by the parties or the UN.

- The Jewish leadership believed that the declaration of independence was the only way to ensure the survival and the security of the Jewish community in Palestine, which faced the threat of annihilation by the Arab forces.

- The Jewish leadership believed that the declaration of independence was the only way to fulfill the historical and the national aspirations of the Jewish people, who had longed for a homeland and a sovereignty in their ancestral land.

- The Jewish leadership believed that the declaration of independence would gain the recognition and the support of the international community, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, which had expressed their sympathy and their commitment to the Jewish cause.

The Jewish leadership prepared the declaration of independence, which was drafted by a committee of experts and approved by the National Council, the representative body of the Jewish community in Palestine. The declaration of independence was signed by 37 members of the National Council, representing various political parties and organizations. The declaration of independence was read aloud by David Ben-Gurion, in a ceremony that took place on May 14.

It was a region of land, similar to how New England is a region that encompasses a broad swath of land. When people say Jesus was Palestinian or similar things, it shows a wild ignorance of history and is no different than proclaiming Jesus was a Zionist or George Washington was a Yankees fan. All are nonsensical.

What many are unaware of is that, historically - and backed up by loads of historical evidence - only Jews in the 30s,40s used to refer to themselves as Palestinian. There were Palestinian soccer teams, the Palestinian Post (later the Jerusalem post) all created by and run by Jews. In 1948, after the establishment of Israel, the jews started to call themselves Israeli, and the name Palestinian essentially evaporated. You ask an Arab in 1950 in Gaza if he was Palestinian and he’d proudly tell you NO. He was an Arab.

Why?

Because Arabs in the region at the time just viewed themselves as Arabs, with no meaningful distinction between Arabs in the levant and Syria/Jordan etc. In fact, many Arabs back then didn’t want their own country but rather to be part of Greater Syria.

This all changed when Yasser Arafat (himself an Egyptian) decided in the 1960s to starting using the name Palestine to create a new national identity that previously did not exist. In doing so, Arafat also stole ‘ Free Palestine’ - previously used by jews in the levant, and much more. This theft of identity continues with odd statements like Jesus was Palestinian, or Palestinians invented every middle eastern food known to man. The Palestinian identity is young and, contrary to propaganda, doesn’t stretch back for thousands of years. The palestinian identity  - in using the term jews used to refer to themselves as - was purposefully used to deligitmize Israel and assert an Arab claim to the land. A clever play on words that has been quite effective in twisting not a narrative, but actual Mid East history.

I dont mention this to diminish Palestinian nationalism or their right to self-determination.  Despite its somewhat manufactured beginnings, there is now a distinct people called Palestinians today in 2024. There’s no point to go back in history. 

So why mention it at all? Because Pro-Palestinian activists are so adamant about diminishing any jewish connection to the land, and are so passionate about arguing that the land is exclusively Palestinian, it’s important to be aware of the full story and not let propaganda get in the way of actual history. 

Those who are quick to argue for the eradication of Israel should be aware that the Palestinian identity they so loudly support is nearly 2 decades younger than Israeli identity.

The idea that Palestinians existed as a distinct ethnicity - different from surrounding Arabs - is simply not true. The idea that there was a Palestinian country that was overrun by jews is simply not true, despite this being a belief held by uneducated leftists who presumably started learning about middle eastern history on October 8.

Palestinians can advocate for statehood, and I myself hope for coexistence, but the historical reality is that Palestinian national identity as we know it didn’t exist until the 1960s. Calling themselves Palestinians is their right, but to do so while bizarrely ignoring Israel’s own right to self-determination is peak hypocrisy.  Acting as if Palestinians have an exclusive right to the land, simply because they co-opted the name Palestine, is ahistorical.

Again, it's only worth referencing this IN RESPONSE to those who argue or diminish the jewish connection to Israel. It's probably not a road pro-palestinians want to go down.","Palestinian identity as we know it, didn’t exist until the 60s, and was previously used exclusively by Jews",0.65,133,0,2024-11-19 19:30:53

Sometimes people just say go back to where you came from. But I feel like one of the major issues is that Jews were obviously expelled from Europe and the SWANA region and experienced genocide/pogroms. I feel that non Jewish Western European powers/politicians and capitalists used this oppression and genocide(that they caused ) to support obviously the creation of Israel (for safety) but also to have an imperial outpost for western influence and control in the region. 

And a major collateral of this was the expulsion of Palestinians as well as the expulsion of Jewish communities from around the world SWANA and Europe. 

My question is If Israel is dismantled.. what is the “free Palestines” goal ? Is it for it to be secular socialist state with freedom of movement and the right for all people to exist on this land regardless of religion and ethnic background?   
  
Because I don't realistically see Jews being able to go back to Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Ethiopia, Germany and Poland in large numbers due to the oppression they would face their.

Also no country can take 7-15 million refugees.

Additionally what happens if the “revolution” results in an authoritarian regime essentially controlled by Iran and is used to establish another religious fundamentalist ethnostate but instead of it being Jewish it is an Islamic fundamentalists' non secular authoritarian state?

lsze6ko,10,"Below is a long answer to you short question :)

In an interview yesterday with Le Monde, A French-Israeli journalist living in Jerusalem, Charles Enderlin (the former TV France 2 correspondent in Israel) discusses the establishment of Hamas and radical Islam in Gaza.

He also discusses the role of religion on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides, but since I don't fully share his perspective, I won't address that point here.

[In his book](https://www.albin-michel.fr/le-grand-aveuglement-nouvelle-edition-augmentee-9782226496614) he describes the growth and emergence of radical Islam  in Gaza, and the strategy of various Israeli governments towards the Muslim Brotherhood, Fatah, and the Palestinian Authority :

Initially, the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that militates for a policy based on Sharia law founded in 1928 by the Egyptian Hassan El-Banna (1906-1949), developed contacts with Palestinians in the 1930s , including the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, whom they supported in opposition to Zionism. Saïd Ramadan (1926-1995), Hassan El-Banna's son-in-law, even founded the Palestinian section of the Brotherhood in 1944. And ties intensified after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.

One man would then play a fundamental role: Sheikh Ahmed Yassin (1937-2004). A Palestinian member of the Muslim Brotherhood during his studies in Egypt, he founded the Mujama al-Islamiya (literally, the ""Islamic Center"") in Gaza in 1973 . It seems that initially, this association had no political ambitions, it claimed to want to spread Islam, defend good morals and develop social works or health services.

Gradually, his supporters extended their influence, got their hands on mosques, distributed Brotherhood speeches, notably those of Sayyid Qutb (extremist, anti-Semitic and anti-Western Egyptian intellectual), then burned down cafes and physically attacked people accused of drinking alcohol or impious morals, all without the intervention of the Israeli military administration. which was then in control of the Gaza Strip.

Extremely manipulative, Ahmed Yassin was able to persuade the Israeli military leaders to give him a free hand. In 1973, at the inauguration of a Brotherhood building in Gaza, he appeared side by side with the Israeli military governor, with whom he cut the ribbon. He was imprisoned several times, but was always eventually released.

Enderlin explains what he calls the "" great blindness "", which would have concerned both the army and the Israeli political elites.

He writes that Israel saw Mujama al-Islamiya as an "" antidote "" (the word used by military officials) to terrorists from Fatah [the Palestinian nationalist organization founded by Yasser Arafat] or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), both secular, who carried out attacks and considered Mujama al-Islamiya members to be "" collaborators .""

For the Israeli leaders, the conflict with the Palestinians could only be territorial, the religious fact and theology, even if fundamentalist, did not interest them. So they were not going to listen to what was being said in the mosques of the Mujama al-Islamiya (and later, of Hamas). And the few who bothered to go – like Avner Cohen, the former head of religious affairs in the Gaza military administration, whom he quotes in the book – were not listened to for a long time, despite their warnings about the violent preaching and hate speech that was made there.

In 1987, the masks were dropped : the Mujama al-Islamiya became Hamas [a term meaning both "" fervour "" in Arabic and an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, "" Islamic resistance movement""], with its dual military and political face.

From the outset, Hamas ' charter calls for "" raising the banner of jihad in the face of the oppressors "" and fighting against "" Zionist and Western imperialisms."" The movement quickly committed its first attacks, first against Israeli soldiers and then civilians . But Israeli blindness has endured, to varying degrees, to the present day.

In 1992, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (1922-1995) expelled 400  Hamas militants from southern Lebanon, to prevent them from interfering in the negotiation process with the Palestine Liberation Organization . However, it has only strengthened the movement : displaced to a camp in southern Lebanon, the Palestinian Islamists have been able to seal an alliance with Hezbollah under Iranian leadership. 

Finally, in 2005, a major step was taken. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (1928-2014) decided to evacuate the settlements in Gaza without negotiation or coordination with the Palestinian Authority still established in the enclave. It was a question of letting Hamas control Gaza and thus preventing the creation of a Palestinian state – as the lawyer Dov Weissglas asserts, then an advisor to Ariel Sharon, whom Enderlin quotes in his book.

Ariel Sharon nevertheless had a policy designed to weaken Hamas : he ordered the assassination of Ahmed Yassin [killed in a targeted Israeli strike on March 22 , 2004].

And in 2007, the Islamist organization launched a coup, expelled the police and institutions of the Palestinian Autonomous Authority and neutralized Fatah, murdering several hundred activists and injuring thousands. Israel lets it happen.

And Ederlin says that this kind of "" blindness "" culminates with Netanyahu... 

Returning to power in 2009, Netanyahu has become a kind of protector of Hamas. He ordered the Mossad to turn a blind eye to the massive transfers of funds from Qatar and Turkey to Hamas. And, according to several former Shin Bet officials, he has also repeatedly forbidden the army to neutralize Hamas' military leaders.

The Israeli political and military establishment was convinced that the Islamists were only seeking to maintain their power over the enclave and that they should therefore be given the financial means to manage it.

In 2011, Benjamin Netanyahu also authorized the release of 1,027  Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, who has been detained in Gaza for five years. Among them was Yahya Sinwar...

He had been in prison since 1989 for the murder of four Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. According to Yuval Bitton, head of intelligence at the prison administration, he was released because he did not have Israeli blood on his hands, despite the threat he posed. 

Yuval Bitton had, over the years, had long conversations with Sinouar. Already, in 2004, he told him, during an exchange he reported to Enderlin: "" We will wait another twenty years and, when we see that you are weakened, we will attack you. Your society is divided, made up of Ashkenazim, Sephardim, and you are in permanent conflict. You will disintegrate, and we will attack you."" 

After his release from prison, Sinwar discovers that Gaza is under the control of a Hamas that is now equipped for war. He then climbed the ladder to power by getting rid of his rivals...till october 7...

l2mb361,-1,"Well, I don't agree that Jewish people are indigenous to the land simply for being Jewish. There are converts to Judaism which make that notion very complicated. Still, this is terminology, and let's put it aside for a moment.

If you think that Jews and Palestinians have an equal right to settle on the land, I can accept that as a fair compromise. I think we can accommodate a state with an immigration policy like this and keep everyone happy. However, where I won't agree is on preventing Palestinians from coming to that state, or making it harder for Palestinian refugees to return to that state compared to Jewish immigrants whose memorable ancestors have never set foot in the region.

Thus, I think I can sum up my opinion here as follows. I can agree with having a state of Israel, though. Where I won't agree, though, and where I don't think any pro-Palestine supporter will agree, is on policies that promote **Jewish exclusivity** in that state of Israel. If having a state of Israel means you **need** to have a demographic majority, then you will make it difficult for Palestinians to live there and impossible for Palestinian refugees to return there (historically, this is what has happened in the state of Israel).

I just would like to have a civil and thoughtful discussion in a time that there is so much hate and anger. I hope you’ll understand.

I believe a lot of people are being asked the wrong questions by interview hosts and others that they resent and therefore don’t want to answer. Therefore I want to propose a new kind of questioning.

Allow me to explain:

Piers Morgan invites a Palestinian activist on his show. He asks them right off the bat if they condemn the events of October 7th. While Piers may have not intended for this to happen, his question maxes this person feel boxed into a corner and they feel resentful, because they feel like this is a judgmental question with an agenda. They express they do not wish to answer this question, which makes Piers further question this person’s morals, which in turn makes the person feel extremely tensed, judged and ganged up on. Before long, the conversation turns heated, into a shouting match and nobody is listening to anybody.

I believe it’s time for a different type of question altogether. The question imo should not be who is right or wrong, but rather, who actually wants peace. Most people say they want peace, but then they blame and finger point to other sides as being wrong, and they become stuck. The whole conversation is stuck, and there is no way to move forward. Why? Because moving forward is no longer the goal. The goal is to stay stuck in the loop of blaming, victimhood, etc.

So in my opinion, Piers is asking the wrong question. Instead of asking, “Do you condemn ____,” he should be asking “Do you want peaceful coexistence with Israel?” It doesn’t bear the judgement that the other question has…and in my opinion should be an easier question to answer.

So I thought I’d ask a question I’d like to hear being asked more often. I ask it specifically to Palestinian activists. But it could also be reversed and asked to Israel. But I’d like to ask it here specifically to Palestinians and those who advocate for Palestine:

If Israel came to you one day and offered to live in peaceful coexistence with you, with your own ability to govern yourselves without any intervention from them, with an adequate supply of food, water, money and other resources, and without any fear of being murdered, jailed, mistreated, etc., would you accept the offer? If not, why not?

I hope this question is clear. And please only answer “yes” or “no” and you can elaborate on your responses if you want. Thank you!",Question for Palestinians and Pro-Palestinian Activists,0.8,27,0,2024-05-04 18:31:04

I grew up in Syria as a palestinian, went to syrian schools and they teach about how some day they will liberate the Golan heights from the israeli occupation.
I took refuge in Lebanon during the syrian civil war and they also teach about liberating the occupied land by israel in the south, especially the Sheba farms and other territories where israel establishes provocative presense.
I met a lot of refugee Gazans in Europe and they were all raised to resist the occupation and free Gaza from its choking siege (then free Palestine)

Before I get into it I'll just clarify that I grew up Jewish and zionist but I'm down the middle rn. I agree that both sides have a right to exist and both sides have gone overboard more than a few times. I am both Jewish and Arab. 
Over the last month, dozens of forensic analysts and witnesses have come out to describe the violence against women that they've seen. 
Women of all ages (especially at the nova festival) 
Gang raped, one after the other, while militants stab them all over their bodies. There was a woman held captive in the festival who recounts being a tent filled with women who were being raped and scalped, didn't even pull up their pants, just went to the next after they were raped to death
I watched a video of a pregnant Jewish woman tied down with tape on her mouth while 2 Palestinian (looked like civilians, a lot of them came to join the fun when they knew the water was fine) sliced her belly completely off, you see her organs pumping and her baby moving around while they yell at her, slap her, and spit on her. 
There was a woman at the festival who was passed around to different Palestinian men, each one mulilated her as they raped her. She and many other women had their breast's and genitals cut off while they were alive. 


My question is, why is it that in the western world, most cases that are not nearly as vicious would be considered abbhorent and evil. Everyone agrees that there is never an excuse to rape. But for some reason I haven't seen a single pro palestian even acknowledge it unless they're saying it's lies and it didn't happen. 
My problem especially with this is that it creates a dichotomy where it's alright for Jewish women to be brutalized and raped as long as it's by an Arab man. When you defend it, you think you're defending Palestinians in some distorted way, but as an Arab I can tell you the reality you might not know about. 
Stealing/humiliating Jewish women is a sport for Arabs. Many of my mothers friends were tricked into marrying what seemed like a very nice guy. But by the time they get married, they wind up being one of four wives and beaten viciously in public. My mom and her friends have seen this unfold. So understand that we've been dealing with this for hundreds of years.

No, Jews did not just show up in Israel in 1948. No, Israel was not a gift given to the Jews by colonial powers. No, Israel did not arise because of the Holocaust or in response to the Holocaust. No, the UN did not create the modern state of Israel.

The modern state of Israel was built and created SOLELY BY JEWS, over a period of almost 100 years, using Jewish capital , Jewish ingenuity, Jewish diplomatic efforts  and  Jewish military power. 
Jews have lived in the Land of Israel , almost continuously, for 3,000 years. In  the years immediately preceding the approval of the  Mandate of Palestine by the League of Nations , over 100,000 Jews lived in the Land of Israel.
Rishon Le-Zion, Zichron Ya'akov, Petach Tikvah and Rosh Pina were established prior to 1904
Agricultural schools were also established  around this time  and some of the students of these institutions went on to found kvutzot , the first of which was established at Degania on the Sea of Galilee in 1909.
Tel Aviv was founded in 1909.
Technion – Israel Institute of Technology ,Israel’s first university, was founded in 1912, 36 years before Israel’s Declaration of Independence. The Technion is credited with conceiving, founding and shaping the high-tech nation of the modern State of Israel.
The Hebrew University was founded in Jerusalem in 1918.
The principle of Jewish self-help was extended to the area of defense with the creation of ""HaShomer"", the Watchman, an association of Jewish guards set up in 1909 to defend Jewish settlements.
Ten years later,  the Histadrut became a powerful and unique institution. Not only did it serve as a trade union, defending the interests of the workers in Mandatory Palestine, but it was also constituted as ""Hevrat haOvdim"" (The Workers' Company), a holding company that owned several large corporations. Thus the Histadrut represented labor while it was in effect one of the largest employers in the Yishuv. The Histadrut also ran the largest ""Kupat Cholim"" (Sick Fund) as well as a vocational school system (Amal), daily newspaper (Davar), publishing company (Am Oved), sports club (HaPoel) and youth movement (HaNoar HaOved), to name only a few of the Histadrut's many activities.
In the same period,  elections were held for the ""Asefat Nivcharim"", the National Assembly of the Jews of Mandatory Palestine. The assembly elected a 36 member executive body known as the ""Va'ad Leumi"" (National Council), which represented the interests of Palestinian Jewry to the British authorities.

By 1939, before one-third of world Jewry was destroyed in the Holocaust, a geographic and demographic nucleus for a Jewish state was present in Mandatory  Palestine. By that date, more than 500,000 Jews and almost 75%  of all the land Jews would purchase by 1948 were already in Jewish hands.

The Jews had built their  state and created all the civic organizations necessary to run their state well before WW2. Again, by 1939 the modern state of Israel existed in all respects but for independence.","No, the modern state of Israel didn't magically come into being in 1948.",0.76,78,0,2023-12-01 23:27:49

His argument for calling the war against the Palestinians as genocide is succinct, and uses Israel’s leaderships own words to make his case. His case is compelling and true. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is critical. Death from dehydration and starvation is cruel and needless. Keeping humanitarian supplies from reaching those that need them the most is unacceptable.

 The decimation of hospitals, licensed doctors, pharmacist, and nurses is unnecessary in the war against Hamas. So why did they bomb every hospital? Because they wanted to deprive the citizens of Gaza access to highly educated and skilled individuals from being available to save Gazan lives. 

The killing of journalists for reporting to the world the truth about the destruction and devastation of Gaza, doesn’t stop Hamas, but it does stop the truth from reaching the global community. 

Destruction of infrastructure of entire neighborhoods isn’t necessarily in the fight against Hamas, but it is necessary to prevent Gazans from returning to their homes and villages.

 As a Jew, I am embarrassed and disgusted by the military tactics of the IDF! As an American, I’m pissed off that my taxes are paying for the levelization of a society. The killing of innocents is never acceptable in war. Colateral damages do occur, but most civilized militaries do everything in their power to reduce the number of casualties of war, even if that means we must let our target walk in order to protect civilians. 

When I’m holding my gun, I realize that it is an extension of myself and that it’s purpose is to protect me, soldier to my left and the soldier to my right. However, I also realize the sheer amount of power I have now added to my body enhances my ability to eliminate the threat. It’s not a toy. It’s not cool. It’s a weapon and it’s primary purpose is to kill. 

Where is the responsibility, dignity, and honor of the IDF soldiers? Why are they dancing and singing in glee after destroying a village and dead checking civilians? That’s murder, not defense. Why are they making TikTok’s to celebrate war crimes? And before anyone tells me that Hamas does it, are the IDF Hamas soldiers or are they Israeli soldiers? Just because Hamas makes videos, or Palestinians give out sweets after the massacre of innocent Jews on 7/10, does not mean that Jews and the IDF should retaliate in the same manner. 

I don’t care that civilians celebrated the deaths of innocent Israeli civilians. They’re fools and their hearts are filled with hatred. Not all Palestinians celebrated or participated in such a vile act. It’s no different from Americans and Israelis cheering for the deaths of ISIS fighters. “If they blew up a few innocent Muslims, then that’s one less Muslim we have to worry about.” Sound familiar? Those that said such things, later regretted those words as the war continued and they got to know the people of Afghanistan. 

When you join the military in the US, you swear an oath: 

“I, M.A. Kohen, Do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.”

The IDF Oath:

I swear and obligate myself on my word of honor to remain loyal to the State of Israel, its laws and its legitimate administration and to devote all of my strength, and even to sacrifice my life, in the defence of the homeland and the freedom of Israel.

The Israeli oath is centered on defense. How are the Palestinians threatening Israeli statehood? I’m aware of militant groups other than Hamas are a threat to Israeli sovereignty and those elements should be eliminated, as they do threaten Israel and her people; however, the civilians are not an existential threat to Israel. The killing of innocent civilians must end NOW! The current situation is unacceptable and unnecessary.

Transcript:

""Any human being right now has to be distressed by what is happening in Gaza, because of the quantity of innocent deaths. I would just like some of the protests to mention Hamas because that's where this started.

And Hamas is a terrorist organization, you know. And it's very strange for young, progressive student politics, to kind of support a fascist terrorist group. You know, because, you know, they're talking about ""free Palestine.""

I mean, I'm somebody who has argued for a Palestinian State for most of my life, since the 1980s, probably. 

Right now, if there was a Palestinian State, it would be run by Hamas. And that would make it a Taliban-like state.  You know, and it would be a client state of Iran. 

And is that what the progressive movements of the Western left wish to create? To have another Taliban? To have another ayatollah-like state, in the Middle East, right next to Israel? 

So, I feel that there's not a lot of deep thought happening, you know. There's an emotional reaction to the death in Gaza. And that's absolutely right. But when it slides over towards antisemitism and sometimes actual support of Hamas, then it's very problematic.""

He has a pretty unique lens on this whole situation after being under a flatwa for so many years for simply writing a book. 

From like 1989 to 1999 the dude had around the clock security provided by the UK and was mostly in hiding. 

Apparently the fatwa was lifted around the year 2000 and then he sort of started reemerging and going on interviews and this sort of thing and was even on Curb famously. 

Unfortunately fate caught up to him and in 2022 he was stabbed in the face and lost his eye and also the use of his hand. 60 minutes actually has a pretty good interview with him that you can find on YouTube.

He really echoes what I think a lot of us are scratching our heads at where we both understand where a lot of pro Palestinian people are coming from but then we are confused because they aren't being very open about denouncing Hamas. 

In fact just from the footage I've seen from many encampments I don't think I've actually seen a single person directly condemn Hamas a  October 7th.

I've seen a fair amount of comments on Reddit that denounce Hamas and then a few on Facebook that are still leaning pro Palestine but it's pretty quiet out there otherwise.

Trump says that Gazans live in Gaza because they ""have no alternative"" but I already know that it's not true. Palestinians live in Gaza because they want to be in a country where they are alike and have one identity.

And the neighboring countries will likely not want Palestinian refugees in there because they don't want a whole population with no housing and struggles from poverty, and they have different culture.

This will likely make people in the West Bank angry as well and will make them harras each other, be racist, segregation, and possibly even more bomb attacks.

Many have been forced to flee with little more than the clothes on their back, leaving behind their homes, possessions, jobs and loved ones. They may have suffered human rights violations, been injured in their flight, or seen family members or friends killed or attacked.

Arguing in favor of this displacement is an endorsement of colonialist practices. The rationale often cited for this displacement is the establishment of a Jewish state. However, this notion is problematic for two reasons. First, the creation of a Jewish state does not necessitate the displacement of Palestinians. Second, the concept of a state dedicated to a single ethnicity, race, or religion inherently promotes the dangerous idea of racial segregation and justifies exclusionary policies. Palestinians should not bear the consequences of Europe's historical crimes, and there is no moral justification for their displacement. While I firmly oppose any form of unjustified violence, it is important to consider the context behind events such as the attacks on October 7. Reports from sources like Haaretz suggest that the Israeli state might have been complicit in the deaths of its own citizens on that day and thus the degree to which Hamas actually killed civillians needs to be critically investigated. Additionally, while the act of hostage-taking is not the most commendable, it raises the question of whether there were alternative methods to secure the release of Palestinians who are being held by Israel without trial, in conditions that effectively render them hostages.

Growing up in the United States, having extended family who survived the holocaust, and being descended from russian immigrants fleeing pogroms at the turn of the 20th century, I learned about world 2, the holocaust, antisemitism, and the formation of Israel through a decidedly ""Israel must exist out of necessity,"" lens.

I learned that zionism was the movement of the late 19th and early 20th century to reestablish the Jewish Homeland where it always was. I learned about the bad too, like Irgun's actions before 1948, and of course the antagonistic (putting it mildly) relationship settlers have with non-israelis in the west bank. Ultimately however, I have never considered myself a zionist, because zionism accomplished it's goal: Israel exists as a Jewish State situated in the historic homeland of the Jewish people.

Since October 7, I have seen zionist used in only one context: as a slur to be applied to someone else that you don't agree with. And anti-zionist used as a self-label by the people using zionist as a slur.  
But what is a zionist in this context? Is a zionist someone who believes that now that Israel exists, it should continue to do so and be able to defend its borders within the bounds of generally accepted international law? Or is a zionist something else and if so, what?

If it is the former definition, then isn't an anti-zionist someone who wishes for the destruction of Israel? Why is it that you can be banned from some subs permanently for calling someone a terrorist sympathizer but not for calling someone a zionist because you don't like their support for israel?

Israel exists.  I believe it has a right to continue to do so, as a State that affords all of its citizens equal civil rights, on nothing less than borders following the green line, in peace with its neighbors and with the right to defend its borders and people from all hostility to the limits permitted by generally accepted international law.

Misinformation is truly the most dangerous thing out there, it is not always incitement but it almost always leads to incitement. A reminder that the Holocaust wasn't started when Auschwitz became operational in 1942 or when WWII started in 1939. It did not start with physical violence at all. It started with laying the rhetorical groundwork, whether by government, academia, or cultural elites, that Jews deserve to die. It is a process that took many years and by the time it reached full scale, killing Jews was a foregone conclusion that was only supported by a very small section of the public, but fully ignored by most of it and actively resisted by almost no one.

Similar stories have been seen in Rwandan genocide, Armenian genocide, whatever you wanna call the Uhygur situation, and most certainly the ""special operation"" in Ukraine by Russia.

I believe this alone justifies a ground invasion of Lebanon.""
Hezbollah has a serious problem with that. Let me tell you quickly.

The ""low-intensity"" war between Hezbollah and Israel has been going on for almost 11 months now. This has played against Hezbollah, because during all this time, Israel has systematically attacked its entire logistical structure in southern Lebanon.

Israel has destroyed ANY NUMBER of bases, weapons depots and factories, barracks, and has eliminated hundreds of mid-ranking commanders (those who actually coordinate the troops on the battlefield).
Hezbollah has NEVER faced that situation.

In a war, THE FIRST THING you have to guarantee is your logistics. Your soldiers eat 3 times a day, they need water, and they need fuel to move around. And not to mention weapons and ammunition. If they don't have them, it's no use having an army of 100,000 Shiites.

Just like that, without many noticing, Israel was destroying PRECISELY THAT throughout the entire southern area of ​​Lebanon: the bases that would have guaranteed Hezbollah's logistics.
The Lebanese terrorist group is therefore in no position to wage a ground war.

Hezbollah also has no air force (or significant air defenses). Its only remaining resource for a war against Israel is its missiles.
It's no small feat, by the way.
It is estimated that it has 150,000 missiles, all of which are intended for use against Israel.

But, as I explained earlier, using them involves a problem: it requires a huge prior logistical deployment (again, the filthy logistics). And the Israeli intelligence services can detect that with relative ease.
In fact, that's what happened today.

Israel detected the movements for a massive attack, and acted in advance. Because it had located where these movements were being made, it destroyed 40 launch sites 15 minutes before Hezbollah launched its attack.

We do not know (and I do not think we will ever know) how many people died among Hezbollah troops as a result of the Israeli attack, but I do not think I am exaggerating if I imagine that it was something more or less definable at the level of a ""massacre.""

Now Hezbollah has had to resort to what it always does: rocket and drone fire against northern Israel, an attack for which Israeli defense systems are well prepared. The shots are being intercepted, and only three minor injuries are reported.

Of course, many Hezbollah rockets and drones are hitting Israel, because the defense systems do not shoot down missiles or drones that are going to fall in unpopulated territory. And a large number of communities in the area were evacuated long ago.

That is why the number of victims in Israel is minimal.
That's the difference: Israel thinks OF EVERYTHING, and prepares for the worst possible scenarios.

On November 9, 2024, the Government Media Office in Gaza posted an updated total for famine deaths: 38.
https://www.alquds.com/en/posts/141290

Catastrophic food insecurity is a designation by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). It means 2-4 deaths per 10,000 people. Given that the IPC has regularly produced reports on the food security situation in Gaza, we can easily calculate expected deaths. If we perform this calculation, we find that, between November 24, 2023 and July 15, 2024, there should have been at least 38,000 famine deaths per the IPC.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zOcGxUrlfYFWfejlD1MBP2CRqYFVD99mhecJL0KMn6w/edit

So why have there only been 38 deaths from famine? One explanation is Gaza’s decimated medical infrastructure. Are they just unable to report the famine deaths?

If so, how do we explain that the Ministry of Health are able to, within moments, count the dead killed in air strikes?

On October 20, 2024, Hamas reported 42,603 killed.

On November 11, 2024, Hamas reported 43,603 deaths.

If they can count deaths from airstrikes, why not famine deaths?

So for one, and most of us know this--Israel wasn't just randomly created with no consultation. A partition plan was proposed, Jews accepted, Arabs rejected.

**""But why did the Arabs have to accept? It's their land! They shouldn't have to partition it!""**

Well for one, they never offered any type of counter-proposal or counter-solution. They just immediately went to war with Israel, before the partition plan was even put into effect. Also, it wasn't just ""their land""--the land technically belonged the British at that point, and there were several Jews living there (more info on this in the next point).

Now if your solution is **""They should have just created a binational/unified state where they could all live in harmony like they did before! Jews and Arabs lived together peacefully before Zionism!""**

First of all, they definitely did not live peacefully. Second of all--many people don't know this, but a binational state *was* proposed--guess who didn't want this to happen either? The Arabs. More info on this: [https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&amp;img\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1) (there are sources for this information in the caption of the post)

Also, when people talk about Jews/Zionists ""stealing land"", they forget that there were Jews living there as well and it didn't all belong to the Arabs of Palestine. Jews had maintained a presence in that land for thousands of years, even after being exiled. Several Jews escaped to Mandatory Palestine in response to the violence of the Holocaust in Europe and the exile of Jews from other Middle Eastern countries. At the time of partition, there were several Jews living on that land who had every right to be there as well. To this you might say:

**""But why did Palestine have to be responsible for all the Jews? It's Palestine's land! It's terrible that Jews were kicked out of all those countries, but why did Palestine have to deal with it?""**

I mean, here's the thing: The Jews who escaped to Palestine did so because there was a growing Jewish presence there and one of the only places they thought they would be safe. And the reason they escaped was because of violence in the countries they came from, so they were essentially refugees. Are you anti-refugee? Because I don't think anyone trying to argue that ""The Jews shouldn't have immigrated to Palestine and just expected the Arabs to take them all as refugees!"" would have any problem whatsoever with America or other Western countries taking in refugees. In fact, I think that anyone who *did* have a problem with refugees coming to Western countries would be seen as very ""anti-progressive"". Is it only ""progressive"" to take refugees in when it's Western countries taking them in?

Now to this you might say: **""But a lot of the Jews who came to Palestine weren't** ***just*** **there as refugees, they were there as part of the 'Zionist project'! They were intentionally lured there to make creating a Jewish state more possible!""**

Sure, there were many Jews who immigrated to Palestine under the ""Zionist project"". But ""being part of the Zionist project"" doesn't negate the fact that many of them needed a safe place to go, and when immigrating to Palestine, I can bet you a good majority of them weren't thinking ""I'm coming here so I can help create a Jewish state!"" No, they were mostly just concerned with escaping for their lives, and probably couldn't give a sh\*t in the moment about whether or not a Jewish state would eventually be created. And even if they did go there as part of some ""project""--does that mean that because of their so-called ""intentions"", they should be forced to leave? In the 1940's, were they going to brain-scan every Jew who arrived with some lie-detecting technology to determine whether or not they were there with the intention of ""displacing Palestinians""? Were they going to send those Jews *back* to the countries that they themselves were displaced from, or where they were violently abused and watched their family members get killed? Were they supposed to just leave and go back to those countries? Because that seems pretty anti-progressive to me.....

Now to this you might say, **""Okay, but Israel was still created on stolen land, and no state technically has a right to exist!""**

Okay then, why am I not seeing you spending even a fraction of your time advocating for other countries to be dismantled, or for the Native people from other countries to ""get their land back""? Also, remember--Jews are also Native to Palestine! Doesn't mean that Palestinians aren't, but Jews are too! Yes, most Jews don't have ancestors that have lived there since thousands of years ago, but Jews have remained present in the land, even if as a minority, for those thousands of years--with many of them living there before Israel was created.

Now in response to this, you might say **""The reason I'm not putting energy into dismantling other states is because they aren't committing atrocities the way Israel is! They've been displacing Palestinians for decades now!""**

Israel has done some pretty atrocious sh\*t, I'm not going to deny that. There are several things they could have dealt with better. But, if you look at some of the things that have happened, there is almost *always* some type of explanation as to why Israel reacted the way they did--going all the way back to how Arabs declared war on Jews in 1948 after the partition plan. All those checkpoints people complain about? They were in response to suicide bombings that Palestine enacted on Israel. Do you expect Israel to just not protect their citizens? Aren't there checkpoints at every international border?

And then if you say **""But again, all of these things you talk about could have been prevented if Israel hadn't been created on stolen land and displaced Palestinians from their homes!""**

...then we're back to square one and you can go back to reading this post from the very beginning 🙂

So, if anyone actually has any ideas as to *what should have happened in 1948 instead of establishing the state of Israel*, I am seriously interested to hear it. I mean this genuinely and not sarcastically. I assume most people responding to this will say something along the lines of either: ""You idiot this post means nothing Israel is still illegitimate!"" or ""Yup, just more proof that the pro-Palestine crowd doesn't know how to think critically.""

When the Zionist came to Palestine in the 1930s (Before the genocide of Jews) with the backing of the British Government (who was in power at the time) they were highly favored and even trained by the British military how to kill unarmed villagers with bayonets. That sets the standard right off the back.

I really want to hear perspectives of US Palestine protesters and would like to understand more of their side. This is not an anti-protester post.

1. ﻿﻿﻿Is the protest supporting Palestine not just about the Palestinian peoples rights or also genocide against Muslims? If both then I ask why not protest against the genocide of the Uyghur or the Rohingya. Or even against the Boko Haram who not only kill non-Muslim people but also Muslims who are considered not extreme enough for them. I'm genuinely curious on what separates this issue from other Muslim issues. Why is the Palestine-Israel case considered more important for national and international protests? 

2. Why are international issues given more priority for protests than domestic ones? For the general American public is this issue personally effecting you? I'm not saying that you shouldn't fight for a cause that you believe in and want to see change in. But why do you think there's more focus for international issues that are halfway across the world rather than other human rights issues here in America. Do you think there could be protests of this magnitude for the Indigenous people whose land you're on? How the treatment of black peoples and African Americans have not changed even since BLM? Why, if the argument is that Palestinians are indigenous, does this issue take precedence over the stolen Indigenous land, freedom, safety, etc. here in the US? Again, I'm not saying you shouldn't fight for what you believe in but I'm curious why this issue and other international issues are experiencing greater concern and coverage over domestic ones?

3. Do you believe and support Hamas' message? What are your beliefs and feelings towards Hamas. Just Hamas not Palestine or its people. When it comes down to Hamas' principles and how they've treated Palestinians throughout the years do you support them? What about Hamas do you agree with. Besides that Hamas says that Palestine needs to be its own state, that's a very obvious and upfront belief. I'm talking about basic principles and beliefs of Hamas.

* https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-said-to-believe-israel-killed-just-20-30-of-hamas-terrorists-in-gaza-fighting/

Some other noteworthy points from the article:

* Both Israeli and American intelligence believe that Israel has seriously wounded thousands upon thousands of other Hamas fighters, but while Israel believe most of those wounded will not be able to return to the battlefield, American intelligence believes that most eventually will.

* The US believes that a side in a war losing 25-30% of their troops would normally render their army incapable of functioning/continuing to fight, but because Hamas are essentially guerrilla fighters in a dense urban environment and with access to vast tunnel networks, they can keep it going for several more months.

* The Biden administration is coming more to the position that a total elimination of Hamas would be too difficult in present circumstances, and that Israel should look at crippling their operating capacity as a final war aim rather than a total annihilation. 

* Hamas for their part simply aim to survive the war, and be left standing in any capacity when it is over. Their credibility revolves around being seen by at least the people of Palestine as a legitimate armed resistance capable of sticking it to the “Zionist entity”, and to protect that position and reputation they don’t have to win by any means, but they have to not visibly lose badly or get wiped out. 

What are your thoughts on this? From a military standpoint is it a successful outcome for Israel to date, or is it less than you or Israel would/should have expected? 

How do you think it influences the path forward? Should Israel press ahead with their offensive in the hopes of eliminating more fighters? Or does it prove that Hamas are too resilient to fall completely and now is the time to turn to peace negotiations?

I'm going to get these points out of the way first and foremost to attempt to forestall any accusations of bad faith.  


1. I believe in Israel's right to exist, though what form that takes likely needs serious re-evaluation.
2. The October 7th attack was horrific and unjustified. If Hamas had strictly limited their actions to military personnel and facilities only, there might have been room for argument on its justification, but they didn't. Many, many innocent Israelis have been killed, maimed, violated, and taken hostage. Hamas should definitely be held to account for this, and their organization should be dismantled and replaced.
3. I am not certain that Israel's actions meet the criteria for genocide, however I believe that the IDF's overall conduct is toeing dangerously close to that line, and is likely already be verging into the realm of ethnic cleansing. At \*best\*, their attacks have been unacceptably indiscriminate, and I believe that they are intended to collectively punish the civilian populace of Gaza.  


This is going to be a long and somewhat winding post, so please bear with me.  


I have read some of the history of Israel's founding and the circumstances that led to this ongoing conflict. I don't believe that either 'side' (acknowledging that each side had multiple factions with competing interests of their own) is free of sin, and I acknowledge that the Arab states in the region are not free of their share of blame for how the conflict started and continued (both from cultural/ethnic prejudices and political exploitation thereof). I also definitely believe that Britain massively screwed up with their handling of that region's geopolitical configuration (go fucking figure).  


HOWEVER, it needs to be acknowledged that the original Zionist movement that led to the establishment of the Israeli state operated on settler-colonial principles, as it would involve mass immigration of European Jews to add their numbers to the Levantine Jews who already lived in the region to establish demographic majority status. Their desire for an independent and Jewish-majority state would inevitably involve the displacement and/or disenfranchisement of the Palestinian populace that already lived there.  


Even accounting for inflaming of antisemitic prejudices and violence by neighboring Arab states, as well as the shuffling ownership of the territory due to World War II and the Ottoman Empire going defunct, I don't believe the founding of Israel would have been possible without this through-line of settler logic, and it likely would have never gotten off the ground without the support of Britain and the rest of the Western world (hence why I believe the colonialism aspect still applies, even if the particular application is different from the 'usual' formula of an empire establishing colonies ala Britain or France).  


And I believe that the Palestinians (both those who stayed and those who fled or were displaced) have very real and legitimate grievances stemming from this. Nobody is going to be happy about external powers playing demographic games in order to strengthen and reinforce another polity at their expense, especially when this includes violent displacement or disenfranchisement (which in most cases it does). All of this being said, regardless of it's highly checkered circumstances, the state of Israel exists. I don't believe it should be scrapped to try and start over. Trying to do so would only lead to even more misery and bloodshed on a far greater scale.  


But this isn't the whole story. The founding of Isreal is only one element of the current conflict, and from what I've read, the Israeli government has for decades consistently attempted to sweep any prior wrongdoings under the rug in order to justify the poor and oppressive treatment of Palestinians. Yes, they've historically had to deal with the aggression of Arab states, and yet it seems like it's the Palestinians, the people with the least power and agency, who consistently bear the brunt of the punishment and loss as a result.  


And this dynamic has only gotten worse since the Israeli Right Wing came into power from the late 70s onward. I would go as far as to say that ultimate responsibility for the current violence can be laid at their feet. They have no desire to either integrate Palestinians into Israel as citizens OR allow them a fully independent state. From what I've seen, they would rather keep Palestinians trapped in this nebulous and quasi-stateless status, continually exploiting the anger and violence created from this state of affairs to maintain their political primacy, likely with the eventual goal of driving them out of Gaza and the West Bank entirely so they can secure complete territorial dominance. They want to take everything, and allow the Palestinians nothing.  


And it seems there is no low they won't stoop to in order to maintain this sick dynamic. They've literally gone as far as encouraging the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin for this end, which Netanyahu was directly involved in inciting. He and the rest of the right wing have encouraged and abetted the ongoing illegal settlement of territory in the West Bank, again leading to more unrest that they can take political advantage of while appeasing their most extremist wings.  


And most damning of all, they have literally aided and abetted the rise of Hamas in Gaza, favoring them over other more moderate Palestinian factions. Again, they use Hamas' violence to justify their especially their oppressive blockade on the movement of people and accompanying economic restrictions over trade, the control and influence exerted over access to vital utilities, and restriction of Gazan access to the Mediterranean Sea, creating yet more anger and misery and accompanying extremist violence, which Hamas also exploits in order to maintain \*their\* hold on power in a sick and twisted, mutually quasi-beneficial parasitic relationship. And again, ordinary Palestinian civilians bear the cost and suffering all the while.  


Instead of trying to take steps to de-escalate and promote peaceful dialogue and reconciliation with the Palestinians, they just keep applying the boot even harder and arguing in bad faith of why they're always right to take the most inflamatory and oppressive approach, and how the Palestinians' suffering is never their fault.  


And now, the tiger they've been riding has finally turned around and eaten their face with the October 7th attack, which has exposed the utter hollowness of their promises of security. And how could it be anything but hollow? The actions of Netanyahu and his ilk have never been geared toward increasing peace and security, but rather of stoking conflict and hatred to maintain their political power and continually and gradually taking more and more from the Palestinians. They have all \*actively\* made the situation with the Palestinians worse over the decades, and now the the consequences have come home to roost to the misery of everyone.  


And now all they have left is to try and cover their asses is to stoke even more hatred and bring down the hammer on the Palestinians as hard as possible to again justify holding onto their position in government, all while continuing to spew their vile, poisonous rhetoric.  


The people of Israel were rightfully horrified and outraged at Hamas' actions. But I'm deeply troubled and frustrated that many Pro-Israeli supporters seem to be willfully ignorant to the context I've outlined above of how we reached this point to begin with, constantly bringing up Arab aggression and genocidal antisemitism as if its an intrinsic cultural trait of Palestinians rather than an outgrowth of decades of very real oppression and apartheid treatment by the Israeli government, in particular as deliberate policy of the Israeli right wing, Netanyahu chief among them in recent years.  


And now, the IDF is heavily bombing densely civilian-populated areas, systematically destroying civilian infrastructure (including vital facilities like power and water distribution/treatment facilities, hospitals, and even agricultural lands), as well as demolishing civil and academic buildings and even graveyards and places of worship. They're flooding the tunnels in gaza with seawater, which will cause even more major pollution to the groundwater supply of Gaza for god knows how long, and there have been regular reports of IDF troops shooting and killing clearly surrendering people and even Israeli hostages.  


And don't even get me started about leaflets and warnings to evacuate in advance. There's absolutely no way to safely evacuate huge masses of civilians from entire urban areas in a day or two without causing immense suffering and chaos all on its own. That's just an impossibility and a bad excuse.  


The IDF's conduct toward the civilian populace of Gaza has been absolutely appalling, and everything I've mentioned so far is actively contributing to an unprecedented spread of acute starvation, lack of clean drinking water, and the spread of disease from lack of medical infrastructure and unsanitary conditions. Combined with the heavy-handed restriction of outside humanitarian aid from being allowed to entry into Gaza, it's become an unmitigated disaster of human suffering.  


To top this all off, the widespread killing of Gazan journalists and Israeli government's near-total block on allowing independent media and journalist teams from entering Gaza to cover what's happening on the ground is \*especially\* damning in my eyes, and it indicates nothing good about the Israeli government's intentions.  


And you know what the worst part is? I don't believe for a second that Israel will succeed in destroying Hamas with this approach. All this death, destruction and suffering they've inflicted in such an indiscriminate manner is only going to create a new generation of rightfully angry and traumatized Palestinians. Some of them, perhaps even many of them, likely won't give a damn about any of the nuance or complexity of the ongoing conflict or Israel's merits, because they've been permanently robbed of their friends, their families, their homes, their health, and any sense of normalcy, and they'll know for a fact that Israel was responsible for it. A good number of these will likely end up feeding Hamas, or its replacement, out of anger at what's been inflicted upon them.  


And again, many Pro-War Israel supporters aren't seeing this. Yes, Hamas deserves to be punished and dismantled, and Israel has been forced to respond to terror of October 7th, but Israel is still responsible for its own actions and conduct in HOW it responds. And yet again, the state is taking the same heavy-handed approach that has continually failed to resolve the conflict before. What this situation calls for is a fundamental re-evaluation of the prevailing political logic (and most pertinently, Israeli government leadership) that led to this situation in the first place.  


And on the more emotional side of things, I'm going to paraphrase the words of a certain doctor, a bit of wisdom that I've been thinking about over and over since this entire tragedy started.  


""You're not superior to people who were cruel to you! You're just a whole bunch of *new* cruel people! A whole bunch of new cruel people, being cruel to some other people, who will end up being cruel to you! The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive.""  


And to those who think that Israel will come out on top with its current methods, I say this:  


""Well, maybe, maybe you will win! But nobody wins for long. The wheel just *keeps turning*.""

The Abrahamic Covenant (Gen. 12:1-3) says, among other things, that God promised the land of Canaan to the Jews forever.

The Biden administration was also wrong to restrict military shipments to prevent a Rafah ground invasion, and I maintain that this has been one of the most insulting policy blunders by far in this war. 

[Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, in an interview with WSJ says](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-israel-turned-the-tide-in-rafah-hamas-pressure-to-make-deal-d5baa104?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=daily-newsletter-paid&amp;utm_content=06-18-24&amp;_kx=BneFieUuam0m6BoehcgWIzaiLf3qA5qf_OvFQ9SPQj0.L87CGh): 

&gt;Why, after months of contemptuous stalling, did Hamas begin to bend?

&gt;“Two reasons,” says Israel Katz, Israel’s foreign minister, in an interview at the Journal’s office. “One, they understand now that there will be no cease-fire without a hostage deal. Two, the IDF is acting aggressively against the terrorists in Gaza. Especially important was entering Rafah,” Hamas’s stronghold at the southern end of the strip.

&gt;Israel cut off Hamas’s supply routes and now holds Hamas “by the throat,” as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put it. Senior terrorists are dropping at a faster clip as Israeli intelligence closes in; half of Hamas’s military leadership has been eliminated. Even after a large Israeli bombardment to kill Hamas’s military chief, Mohammed Deif, who is considered unlikely to have survived, Hamas barely attacked in response and rushed to clarify that it isn’t leaving negotiations. “Hamas is under much more pressure now,” Mr. Katz says. “That’s what made the difference.”

&gt;Israeli intelligence confirms it. **“We see now the signs that there is a lot of pressure from the military arm of Hamas. They push the leaders in the hotels outside”—Hamas’s politicians, who live in luxury in Qatar—“to achieve an agreement. It wasn’t like that before,” Mr. Katz says. Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, “didn’t want a deal before. Not even when we offered everything.”**

&gt;**It shouldn’t be a surprise that pressure on Hamas could yield gains in negotiations.** Yet for months Western powers took the opposite approach, pressuring Israel to end the war and leave Hamas victorious. They called for an “immediate cease-fire,” increasingly delinked from a hostage deal. Humanitarian groups upbraided Israel and kept quiet about Hamas. The International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court menaced Israel with bogus prosecutions and tribunals.

&gt;“The main reason that this murderer, Sinwar, didn’t do the hostage deal is because he expected the world to stop Israel without it,” says Mr. Katz. “He expected the ICJ, the ICC, the Security Council, maybe a conflict between the United Nations, Israel and the EU”—surely one of them would force Israel to capitulate. Time was on Hamas’s side, no matter how many hostages it kept or killed.

In other words, there was no need to come to a ceasefire prior to the Rafah invasion. There was absolutely no need to capitulate to Hamas and let them rebuild. If you were reading sources like [Tablet](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-succeeding-gaza) or [John Spencer](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israel-has-created-a-new-standard-for-urban-warfare-why-will-no-one-admit-it-opinion/ar-BB1kw2Wf) , and not paying attention to the mainstream media, you would have known that the IDF was kicking Hamas' butt. 

Hamas has been severely crippled. The [IDF now has vast amounts of intelligence on them](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-811143), their tunnels are destroyed, their battalions are defeated. The only things that are left is to ensure that Hamas doesn't govern the day after and the remaining hostages are released. 

[The Jerusalem Post also reports: ](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-811517)

&gt;**Hamas's military wing no longer operates in large formations and has shifted to guerrilla warfare. The working assumption on the ground is that Hamas can plan attacks but currently prefers not to fight, thus retreating from any place the IDF reaches.**

&gt;**It is assessed that Hamas's retreat policy is due to the loss of experienced operatives and commanders and a shortage of weapons. Hamas's equipment shortage is so severe that they recently started using ""reverse"" cameras taken from vehicles as security cameras.** The organization has also begun booby-trapping water tanks to harm IDF soldiers scanning the area.

This is pretty much a major, major success for Israel. 

What I hope to see from the rest of the world is an apology, maybe even some self reflection that they shouldn't be so quick to condemn Israel. There is no need for political sanctions, and it is insulting to assume the IDF doesn't know what they are doing. The IDF continues to be an effective, professional army that is accomplishing their military objectives. 

I sincerely doubt that the world will give an apology and I fully expect to be called a propagandist or a bot, but the WSJ interview should be indicative that what the mainstream media are telling people and what the reality is are two different things. 

As the war against Hamas wraps up, and hopefully all the remaining hostages are released, Israel can fully turn their attention to Hezbollah. Since it's much easier to fight a war on one front than two (much less seven!), Israel would not be as bogged down.

Having done away with the failed COIN tactics seen in Iraq/Afghanistan, Israel's new tactics will probably be studied for decades to come. ",The Rafah ground invasion has been a success,0.67,110,0,2024-07-29 05:05:05

And so given common Palestine supporters claims: israel is based on colonising the land of the indegious people already living there and Israel is commiting war crimes in a war against a muslim country.

Wouldn't America be just as bad and undeserving of existing as israel? if not worse given israel did have the famous september 47 vote where the UN decided jews had the right to make a jewish country in the land that is currently israel/palestine.

So american palestine supporters what is your solution to this? Do you belive america also has no right to exist or is there a reason that America is better/different then israel that gives it the right to exist because Im not seeing too many anti america protests.

This post is not here to argue im here to gain insight and prespective into this ""flaw In logic"" that popped up in my head a while ago and understand the other side a little better. and maybe give some prespective and insight back.

Also this post is not here to ask if israel should exist as im sure there are enough posts on the sub about this it is asking if for the sake of the argument we accept israel shouldn't exist would that make america also have no right to exist.

Although a realpolitik analysis would be that the status-quo will remain because of geopolitical factors, it does create an issue of trust.

Starting with Harris, the far-left has turned on Harris because of Gaza, and have endorsed Jill Stein because they want to punish the democrats. However, the moderate progressive left, represented by the squad, Sanders, and media personalities like Michael Moore, John Oliver, TYT and the like have endorsed Harris. But there seems to be a certain assumption/condition that the white house approach to Israel will change after the election. Michael Moore even seems to speak quite confidently that he believes that Harris will end support for Israel after the election.

Is he a dupe? A hack?  Or are the Pro-Israel voters still supporting Harris not seeing the problem that Gaza has created for the democrats?

It is clear that the democratic establishment want to avoid even talking about Israel in public, because of the split within the party. But over the long run, I believe there is a higher likelihood of Harris turning on Israel because of the damage Gaza has done to the democratic brand. It just seems unsustainable for them to ignore their progressive activist base forever and continue to loose the progressives influencers that has stuck by her even as the left has turned. 

Trump has problems as well, and both Meloni and AFD have shown that far-right parties cosying up to Israel for personal gain does not guarantee their alliance when it counts. I feel that the anti-Israel elements among republicans are too powerless to really change the special relationship. Even the Israel-sceptic far-right that aligns with Trump generally believe that Ukraine is a bigger issue than Israel.

kxbzwor,2,"&gt;Yes, although to be fair it's hard to argue modern-day Israelis and Palestinians are the same people in any meaningful capacity, it's quite easy to imagine a civic shared nationhood but even if Palestinians did that or pretended Israelis were part of their same ethnic nation somehow Israelis simply wouldn't be interested in such an idea

Completely agree. And I didn't mean, in my initial comment, to ignore the obvious point, which is, Israeli (Jews) have no interest in a binational state and even the broadest form of Palestinian Nationalism would have no appeal to them.

I wish people outside of Israel/Palestine, who have no real connection to it, and tend to project their own values and beliefs on foreign peoples, would understand that Israel and Palestine aren't Berkley or Seattle and, although leftwing progressives living in the West may think both religion and nationalism are passé, it definitely isn't to the people who live in the region.

Speaking of the Old Yishuv, New Yishuv and their relation to nascent Palestinian Nationalism - a good, short book to read might be ""1929 - Year Zero of the Arab-Israeli Conflict.""

It's been a while since I read it, but it did detail the difference the Palestinian Arabs expressed towards the Old Yishuv vs. New Yishuv (unsurprisingly, they had better feelings towards the Old). The Old Yishuv, although non-Zionist, and often critical of Zionism and of the new Jewish immigrants, didn't ostracize the newcomers; there was still a sense of camaraderie with fellow Jews even if they disagreed on politics and in attitudes and relations with the Arabs. Palestine's Arabs cannot be faulted not to have known the inner disagreements and politics of the Palestinian Jewish community and, eventually, the earlier distinction between the Old Yishuv and the Zionists - to the Arabs - went away. The violence of 1929 (the book details as well killings of Arabs by Jews, which I had never known about) probably cemented that there were two distinct nationalisms in Palestine with little hope of bridging them into an overarching identity or consensus.",IsraelPalestine,2024-03-31 00:43:52,1brc0zi,RNova2010,0,2,0,True,2023-10-12 05:20:01,0.0,0.0,61.0,11377.0,11438.0,45,"I have a question for Palestinian nationalists. What is your criteria for a Jewish person to belong to the Palestinian nation? You hear often that Palestinians aren't against Jews but only Zionists, and that they explain that the Palestinian nation included a minority of Jews. But today, where there are no Jews living in Palestinian-administered territories (in Areas A or B or in Gaza), I'm curious what criteria someone a Jewish person would have to meet to be considered part of the Palestinian nation.

Is it based on ancestry? If so, how far back would a Jewish person living in Israel-Palestine have to trace their ancestry to Palestine? What is the actual cutoff for which the person needs to trace their family's linege to the land of Palestine?

* Is it that they have to have ancestry living in Mandatory Palestinian pre-1948, when the state of Israel was founded?
* Is it that they had to have ancestry living in Palestine before 1922, before the British Mandate of Palestine started?
* Is it that they have to have ancestry living in Ottoman Palestine pre-1917, when the Balfour Declaration was made?
* Is it that they have to have ancestry that lived in Ottoman Palestine pre-1882, when the first Aliyah started, and the Hibat Zion and Bilu started?
* Is there a different cutoff?

Or alternatively, is it based on ideology? Does it just require renouncing the idea of Zionism and supporting Palestinian self-determination in the land?

Is it based on culture? Needing to speak Arabic at home? Adopting Palestinian customs?  
Or is it impossible? That Palestinian nationality is tied to being Muslim or Christian, and Jews by definition are not a part of it.  
Or is it based on something else?

...Also, I'm curious about not only about people's own opinions, but also about official positions of Fatah and Hamas and other Palestinian factions. 

And most importantly, what are the implications for this in your vision of a future Palestinian state (either in 1967 boundaries or in all of Palestine)? ",Question for Palestinian Nationalists,0.73,45,0,2024-03-30 07:24:33

Many Israelis try to do ""hasbara"" (explanation).
In this process we are trying to provide a counter with the small number that we are, to the aggressive arab and Palestinian propaganda that has been going on for years.

I noticed that there is something common to almost all the posts written by Israelis on the net,
They are formulated in a gentle and apologetic manner that suits people who lived in exile for most of history in countries where the majority are not Jewish.

Let me explain how I see the situation.

Jews lived most of their history in exile mainly in Muslim and Christian countries where they were persecuted for being Jews.
whether you like it or not but history is factual, there is no country the Jews lived in where they were not murdered and persecuted just for being Jews with the exception of India.

The fact that we had to live closed in our communities make us developed some attributes in our collective personality.

One of them is that Israel is trying to explain to the world in an apologetic way that we have the right to defend ourselves when they try to kill us
While we are trying to make comparisons between wars waged by the Western world with ISIS for example.

""Yes, maybe it's okay that innocent people get hurt because of course you, the people of the Western free world, with your pure soul, also had to take the lives of innocent people to keep your people from danger, war is war and innocent people get hurt during it, Jews did not invent this phenomenon"" 
It's just an apologetically disgusting narrative to me.

So now I will present you with a slightly less apologetic narrative and if we have already started the tradition of comparing us to the behavior of Muslims and Christians throughout history, then I will not break the tradition.

The main difference I see between Muslims and Christians and Jews is that Judaism is not an open religion that wants you to be Jewish like Christians and Muslims want you to join their religion.

And so the Christians spread their religion aggressively through crusades, and the Muslims also did it with many conquests throughout histore.

You know who didn't try to aggressively spread their religion throughout history? 
True, Tibetans, but who else? 
The Maori, you are right, but why is it so hard for you to say that the Jews didn't try to turn you into Jews? 

oh right... 
Antisemitism is the oldest form of evil in this world.
On campuses in the western world you can find words like colonialism, genocide and apartheid being shouted loudly.

These voices are heard by young people who are probably very ashamed of the fact that their fathers are responsible for the creation of these concepts, and do not realize that they are continuing the path of their fathers by attributing these concepts to the Jews now.

This is antisemitism.

The funny part is that they are aware that in order to do these terrible things your profile has to be a white person from the West so they tell themselves that Jews are white people who only came from Europe, the fact is that I am a Jew whose ancestors lived in India throughout the years and color my skin is brown, find it really funny.

The next time you want to protest about behaviors you really don't agree with, look in your parents, grandparents and grandmothers eyes and ask hard questions about Christianity and Islam in their time.

And don't drop what's yours on us because you can't face the fact that you did it, and well... we don't.

So no, I'm not going to argue with you about whether the Jews have the right to defend themselves because there is some fact from 876 that justifies our being in this land.

I'm just going to say that Jews have a right to defend themselves because Jews have a right to defend themselves.

But it seems like the IDF(and Israel) is held to a higher level of criticism than Hamas. Everyday I hear something ""bad"" that Israel did. 9 times out of 10 it was something completely justifiable or just flat out a lie. But Hamas can literally target civilians or kill their own civilians and no one says anything. It seems Hamas is getting away with horrible things but people aren't criticizing it at all. In fact they get praised for some of the awful things they do. On the other hand every move or mistake Israel makes gets blasted everywhere. 

With that said, there is also massive misinformation and propaganda campaigns that really paint Israel in a bad light. Obviously, both sides do put out propaganda but it seems like Hamas has a very strong and effective propaganda campaign going, while Israel doesnt seem to be dispelling any of the misinformation and if they do it's delayed. Is it important for Israel to dispell some of the propaganda? When speaking to people about Palestine it seems like their arguments and talking points are flooded with misinformation and they are not changing their minds. In the long run, will this information warfare affect the worlds perception to the point where it could change the outcome for the worse? If so is there more that should be done to combat this?

I'm trying to wrap my head around it because I get so frustrated reading articles or hearing news reports and journalists completely lie and people believe it without question. Many things Israel gets accused of is the very things Hamas are guilty of. 
Is there a solution to this? It seems this is damaging Israel's reputation so shouldn't there be a higher importance place on combatting this?

P.S also I've ran into people that don't even understand basic facts.

Obama, however, had other plans. Malcolm Honlein, Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of the Organizations  of the central Jews in the United States, told Obama: ""If you want Israel to take risks, its leaders must know that the United States stands to their right.""

Obama told him, ""Look at the last eight years,"" he said. ""During this period there were no divisions opinions between us, and what did we get out of it? Without any margin between us, Israel simply sits at zero act from a political point of view, and it erodes our credibility vis-a-vis the Arab countries""

A few days passed after Bar-Ilan speech and the Americans began to change their tune their initial positive. When it became clear to them that the Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's words, The administration again drew the wrong conclusion: if the Palestinians do not adopt the proposal, additional pressure must be put on Israel, and not on the Palestinians. 

Although the freeze continued, the Palestinians did not agree to negotiate. Abu Mazen found endless excuses not to come to the discussion table. And why would he come? After all, the United States continued to put pressure on Israel for him, and if he entered into direct negotiations he would be forced to address Israel's conditions to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and compromise on key issues such as security arrangements and the right of return. 

It was later told that Obama gave Abu Mazen a secret pledge to establish a Palestinian with full sovereignty before he left office. 

The Obama admin accepted every Palestinian excuse without question and never asked anything from the Palestinians, not essential things and not even trivial things. With such automatic American backing, the Palestinians could not be expected to respond seriously to Israel's demands to stop inciting terrorism and recognizing Israel as a Jewish state which means giving up on the Right of Return.

I do not see much hate for palestinians, arabs or muslims from the Israeli or Jewish side. I watch Corey Gil shuster's videos on youtube and even post oct 7 half of the israelis he interviews in his videos are still talking about peace (which is crazy to me) and genuinely do not appear to hold a grudge against Palestinians.

On the flip side, I see an absurd amount of hate from Palestinians, muslims, arabs and their leftist allies towards Jews and Israelis. To the point that it's actually kinda scary. And you don't even have to look to find it. Any video with a jewish person in it will have muslims in the comments harassing them. Any time a jewish person is killed or hurt they are all over the internet cheering, celebrating and allahu akbaring. I follow a Jewish celebrity on Instagram and he posts about the hostages a lot and when he posted about the 2 red headed babies who are still being held captive, the comment section was filled with pro-pals attacking him, saying they don't care, posting palestinian flags, just vile stuff on a post about literal babies.

I’ve seen other people online state this and get attacked for it, and it honestly baffles me. How do people not understand that those labels can coexist? People get so caught up in their own perceptions of what those terms should mean, but they fail to acknowledge that labels aren’t always black and white. You can hold complex, nuanced views that don’t necessarily fit into one rigid category. It’s frustrating because these labels have become so politicized, and often, the true meaning of the terms gets lost in the noise.

You guys can disagree, and that's fine, but that won’t change the fact that it's a fact—both perspectives can exist simultaneously. Just because someone identifies as pro-Palestinian doesn’t mean they must oppose the rights of Jewish people to self-determination in Israel. Similarly, being pro-Israel or a supporter of Zionism doesn’t automatically mean you’re dismissing the struggles of Palestinians or their right to sovereignty. These positions aren’t inherently contradictory, but they are often framed as such by polarized rhetoric that reduces complicated issues into an “either/or” debate.

Pro-Palestinian doesn’t have a singular or fixed definition. It can mean many different things to different people—whether it's about supporting Palestinian human rights, advocating for an end to occupation, or seeking justice for displaced families. Zionism, on the other hand, does have a more concrete definition, one centered around the belief that Jews have the right to self-determination and to live in their ancestral homeland of Israel. Both labels can coexist, and both positions can be argued for in ways that don’t necessarily cancel each other out.

m0x5w22,45,"It's a long and complicated history that could fill up several books. There aren't really any ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" because it all depends on your world view. Everyone thinks they are a good guy. But in the West we like to think of pretty much all of those who are fighting as the bad guys except for the Kurds. But because of international pressure from countries like Turkey, nobody can formally support them (except Israel who sent official diplomats to speak to them a few hours ago). Asad, the current leader of Syria (for now) is a war criminal who has used chemical weapons on his own people. On the other hand, there are rebel groups that are aligned with ISIS, Hezbollah, Al-Qada and Iran. So not many ""good"" options going on.

How does this relate to Israel? Israel and Syria are officially at a state of war and have been since the 70s. The Syrian regime has just had other things going on, especially since the Civil War started about a decade ago, so they weren't acting on it much.

Just to add to this whole mess, there is an ethnoreligion called the Druze who live maiy in northern Israel, southern Lebanon and South Eastern Syria. Part of their religion is being very patriotic and defending their land. The Druze of the Golan Heights have been supporters of the Asad regime in the Civil War because they view them as the rightful rulers who they need to defend. Back in about 2015 or 2016, when the rebel groups started attacking a Druze town called Homs in Syria, many from the Israeli Druze town of Majdal Shams tried to cross the border (about 5km separate the two villages) and protect their brethren. After that incident, the IDF has promised them that they will protect that town so that we can all avoid civilians crossing borders to fight in wars and we can keep it to armies. There is a trend in the town though of feeling less and less connected to the Asad regime and more and more connected to their Israeli identity, especially after 12 Druze children were killed in a Hezbollah attack a few months ago as part of the Israel-Lebanon war and the ever escaping memory of the area being under Syrian rule.

Ps this is a terrific forum and I have learned so much here from both sides. 

Ok - Here are my questions to the USA Muslims and Palestinians in this group. Ps I am an American non Christian non denominational Quaker. 

The Trump party sides with Netanyahu, who Would like all the Palestinians in Gaza to go away.  The Biden Party breaks its ‘own’ boundaries with Netanyahu drawing a line in the sand about humanitarian aid and then when Netanyahu steps over it, capitulates and gives him more arms anyway. 

That’s really it for our political parties. The others really are mainly just for stealing votes from the main parties. 

I can understand not voting for Biden because of this. I can understand not voting for Trump because of this. I can not understand voting for Trump. I’m still not sure what Harris thinks although I think she’d be the best if those three. That’s not saying much. 

Fill me in on your thoughts about this if you wish please. Do you vote? How did you handle this election? Although I am over 70 years old and know a lot about a few things , this entire Netanyahu vs the Palestinians is mystifying to me.

I was looking to get some opinions on what exactly being pro-Palestinian means. I tried to post this in the r/ palestine group but their rules are super strict on what type of content is allowed on that thread.  
  
Some background - I'm a Jewish American who grew up learning a ton about the history of my people since the land called Israel was 'Israel' thousands of years ago all the way until 1947 where I learned more about the history of Israel. I know a ton about the Israeli perspective of things but I never really learned a ton about how Palestinians saw things. For example - What I learned from the Israels independence war in 1948 was that the surrounding Arab countries attacked and told the Muslim populations to clear the areas ahead of time. And after the war, Jewish Arab/European settlers moved into empty homes. I never even heard the term 'Nakba' or knew about different gang wars (for lack of a better term) between the religions even leading up to 1948. I don't mean to argue any of those points I just mention it as an example to the educational differences. I strive to be a centrist on issues and am just looking for a little perspective to learn more.  
  
I was wondering what it exactly means to be pro-palestinian? All of my friends want the Palestinians to live in peace and prosperity. With good leadership that looks out for the people's interests, boosts in their economy to improve quality of life/life expectancy, etc.. Many of my Muslim/palestinian friends agree with me that Hamas nor the PA help with these things. Mainly because of the fixation on attacking Israel. So my question kind of evolves to: is being pro-Palestinian anti-Israel for their whole land? Anti-Israeli presense in the west bank? Or something similar to that. In other words, is being pro-palestinian mean pro-fighting against Israel? Which basically means that Palestinians don't always get a lot of the stuff I talked about in the beginning of this paragraph.

Sweden is among the top 5 donor countries to UNRWA. Sweden plans to increase its humanitarian aid to Gaza next year to 800 million Swedish Crown ($72 million) but not through UNRWA. The humanitarian aid to Gaza will instead be going to other organizations such as World Food Program, UNICEF, Red Cross, etc… 

This is in response to the new Israeli law banning UNRWA operations in the country beginning late January next year. 

In the meantime, the Dutch parliament announced a gradual phase out funding for UNRWA. The Netherlands being a top ten donors to UNRWA. If the bill passes through the Dutch Senate and is signed into law, it will cut contributions to UNRWA from €19 million to €15 million in 2025 and will continue to decrease annually until 2029 when only €1 million will be granted.

I've never had any serious thoughts about islam until I saw a video by one of a famous youtuber Hamza Ahmed about why he started reading the Qur'an.

Being an atheist, I am currently handling an existential crisis with my career and love life and that was what made me slip into the thought of considering Islam might be the way forward for me.

Thankfully my inquisitive mind started researching Islam and I found many disturbing things about the origin of the religion ~~and I was able to relate almost 60 - 70% of all world problems to this religion one way or the other~~.

Now that's when I started researching about what's happening in Israel and Palestine.

I'm not able to understand how most of the Leftist world is supporting Palestine.

As of my understanding, Judaism is the oldest abrahamic religion and Jerusalem is its holy place from 10th century BC.

Christianity originated from around Jerusalem and Jesus was a Jew himself by birth.

So even the Bible proves that Jews lived around Jerusalem (the now land of Israel) since a long time than Christians and Muslims ever were.

Whereas Islam originated in Medina, Saudi and almost everyother place they are in now is mostly through conquest.

No really sure how the land of Palestine belongs to anyone other than Jews though.

So when jews were killed everywhere, they had to come back to their own land and form a country.

And since then everytime there was a war, the Palestinians started it.

Even when every single time Israelites offered peace - even by giving back the captured Gaza at one point.

Even now, it was the Hamas (Palestinians) who first attacked Israel.

Palestinians voted for Hamas.

They knew the ideology and the action plans of Hamas and still voted for them.

Hamas attacked Israel and raped and killed innocent citizens.

What's Israel supposed to do other than destroying Hamas and making sure Hamas doesn't message with them and ruin their peace all over again?

Why is Israel posed bad by most of the world for doing what it's supposed to do?

Am I missing something?

I listened to some of the Indian media who were against Palestine but I don't want the influence of hindutva - I'm aversive of that ideology as well.

Can you guys give me an unbiased view on why Palestine is posed as the victim by most of the world even though they were the ones who wants to kill and attacked Israel every single time?

Why can't they just co-exist and make peace?

Then, when they are proven wrong they use an argument such as: 'we are all colonizers if you look back far enough'... Then why does it matter? Anyway, I am going to write this post as a way of gathering some of my research, so that many of my fellow Jews and friends that support Israel may use this research as a way of debunking claims that we are not natives of the Levant. 

1. **Historical data**: First on the list is the large amount of historical and archaeological evidence that supports Jewish heritage in the Levant. The Zayit stone is one of my favourite artefacts that proves that Jews were inhabiting the region in the early 10th Century BCE and was an established culture. The stone consists of an inscription of the Hebrew alphabet (1). The Merneptah Stele is an inscription made on behalf of the Pharaoh Merneptah, in which it describes a battle that took place between the Israelites and the Egyptians at around 1200 BCE, proving that Israel was a culture and possibly a state at around this time (2).  The Tel Dan inscription is another artefact found in Israel, dating back to the 9th century BCE and contains proof that a 'House of David' existed in Israel which corroborates with the Torah. The inscription describes the slaying of Jehoram who also appears in the Torah (3). I can go on and on with more and more historical data but I think these 3 items make it undeniable that Israel was a place, Hebrews did live there and that atleast some of what the Torah says is based on actual events that occurred. 
2. **DNA:** Genetic mapping studies clearly show that all Jewish populations are closely related Middle Eastern and North African people. Even Ashkenazi people (4). In fact, Palestinian people are pretty much an average of the DNA of all Jews, ranging from Mizrahi to Ashkenazi. I am not saying that all Palestinians are native to the Levant, as it is clearly documented that many Arabs migrated to Israel for work purposes in the early 20th century, but the studies were pretty conclusive that Palestinians and Jews are essentially the same people. I know that this is not what alot of Jews want to hear, but science cannot lie. But as for the myth of Jews being European, the fact that Ashkenazi Jews are so closely related to Middle Eastern populations should disprove the 'European Myth' very easily. 
3. **Moral point of view:** Lastly, if anyone does try to discredit your birth right to live in the lands that your ancestors slaved over, died for, were exiled from and dreamed of returning to for hundreds of years, ask them this: How would they feel if it was them? Forget what is happening right now, because any intellectual knows that whataboutisms are just a way or avoiding the question, how would they honestly feel if their ancestors had been persecuted/killed in every country they visited? How would they feel if they belonged to a people that had no nation? No one to protect them? After what happened in the holocaust how could we trust anyone else to protect us but ourselves? You see the antisemitism in the west, over 60% of hate crimes are directed towards 2% of the population, how could you honestly expect us to live with this? 

For everyone that is Anti-Israel, how would you honestly feel if you were a Jew?

I'm an Israeli from Tel Aviv, who found himself quite troubled with the recent war.

For many years, and even now, I have supported a Palestinian state. I think they deserve it. I know Palestinians live worse lives than almost all Israelis, like Palestinians in Gaza being unable to leave whenever they want, and Palestinians in the West Bank being confronted almost daily by soldiers and often harassed too. I know that if I were a Palestinian, I would be extremely angry at Israel and would've wanted to resist too.

**However,** I can't wrap my head around the hate we saw on October 7th. The indiscriminate murder of people dancing peacefully in a music festival in Re'im, the targeting of people just wanting to sleep in in their houses in Kibbutzim, and the kidnapping of so many innocent people.

I get that life in Gaza sucks, and I get that Israel is largely responsible for this. But I can't for the life of me get in the shoes of the Hamas terrorists who attacked Israel on October 7th. If it was an act of resistance, why did they not target soldiers / army bases on the border only? Why did they have to murder and kidnap so many innocent people, including women, children, and babies?

Perhaps what was even worse on October 7th is seeing all the people - thousands, maybe dozens/hundreds of thousands - cheering on the streets of Gaza as the hostages were being brought in by Hamas. So much hate. I can understand why Palestinians hate Israelis, but that felt too much, like extreme hatred that I really can't wrap my head around - being so happy to see innocent people kidnapped and abused like this. And the amount of people celebrating seemed so high, it felt like *almost all* of them wants *all Jews* to die.

As any Jewish Israeli, I've become furious and enraged on October 7th, and wanted an extremely violent response against Gaza afterwards. However, I still didn't want indiscriminate killings of innocent people in Gaza, in opposition to what Hamas wanted - and did - on October 7th.

The bottom line is that I'm conflicted because on the one hand, I want to believe Palestinian terrorism stems from decades of mistreatment by Israel, leading to extreme frustration, radicalization, and turning to terrorism. **On the other hand,** it often seems like millions of Palestinians - if not most of them - just hate us because of who we are, regardless of how we treated them historically. After all, there were attacks against Jews by Palestinians far before 1948, some cases even happening in the 1800s. So maybe it's all just blind Jew hate, and if that's the case, what happens if we give them a sovereign state with an army? Will they just kill millions of us with the newfound military capabilities they just didn't have on October 7th?

My views are on the Israeli left and we're often called naïve by the center and right, and sometimes I can't help but feel, maybe that's true... Maybe most of the Palestinians are too radicalized to want peace. Maybe they hate us to such deep extents, that peace by a Palestinian state is just a too hopeful dream.

I know Palestinians are humans just like I am. I know they're not born violent or hateful, and they have hopes, dreams, and aspirations just like I do. I know a big part of their frustrations is them seeing how Israelis are having better lives than them, not being interrogated by soldiers often, and being able to travel abroad freely. But also, the amount of hate seems extreme, and perhaps beyond just because of the occupation. 

So, why? Why this extreme hate we saw on Gaza on the 7th? Most of the hostages were not even soldiers, so even if they resist an occupation, why be so happy to see innocent Jews dying / being kidnapped?",a conflicted Israeli on peace with the Palestinians,0.88,100,0,2024-03-29 01:12:48

These nations allowed and even at times supported the west invading Iraq, bombing Syria, intervening in Libya, etc, etc. And watched millions of Muslims die throughout these conflicts, why would they change their tone about Palestine? 

I am not trying to sound cynical and I am not saying these nations shouldn’t be called out and condemned but let’s stop pretending we expect anything out of these western puppets.

This is pretty unbelievable, but as a lot of you might already know UNRWA and the UN are deeply compromised organizations that have been infiltrated by Hamas.   
Originally it was through that UNRWA was an organization the aims to help refugees.    
Palestinians have classified themselves as refugees for over 75 years, this is 2nd and 3rd generations of people classifying themselves as refugees.  Obviously a false claim.  A refugee is a direct thing.    
UNRWA has been shown to teach Palestinian children to become martyrs and to want the destruction of Israel and the death of the jews and the west.  Also the U.N. has been shown to be complicit in many of these things.    
We already know that all of the money that has been sent to Palestinians has been taken by Hamas to support their genocidal war effort.    
UNRWA employees have been shown to participate in the Oct 7 attacks.  Our governments need to stop supporting UNRWA and the UN and dismantle these organizations or at the least get rid of the dirt that has infested them.  We need to rid ourselves of prejudice, jew hatred and terrorism in general.  As you can see in these videos a large Hamas base is found in these tunnels directly under the UNRWA headquarters.  Not a base, not an office but HEADQUARTERS!! Yet they claim they didn't know.  Clearly they are lying.  It would be impossible to build or operate anything of this scale without UNRWA knowledge.  The second video shows many of the issues that expose UNRWA for what they really are.  I encourage you to watch both videos and to support the fight against Hamas.

First is the definition of a hostage: a person seized or held as security for the fulfillment of a condition.

By this definition the 200 something people that were taken by Hamas on October 7th are definitely hostages.

But this definition also fits the 2.5M people that have been locked in a concentration camp for the last 70 years, many of which were born into that bondage.

Shouldn't Israel release their 2.5 million hostages before Hamas releases their 200 something hostages? Or really, if Israel releases their 2.5 million hostages, don't their 200 hostages get released as a consequence or byproduct??

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJp0N6B0jms

is that the distinction being made pertains to the intent behind civilian deaths. When Hamas attacks, they deliberately target civilians and even take civilian hostages. When Israel retaliates, their intent is not to kill civilians, as evidenced by their warnings and providing escape routes from bombings, but rather to target Hamas. However, when they attack and target Hamas, unfortunately, due to the compact nature of the area and the intertwining of Hamas with civilian infrastructure, it becomes inevitable that there will be a high number of civilian casualties. Therefore, the distinction of intent is crucial when considering civilian deaths. Now, the question arises: what should Israel do when Hamas attacks? If they do not counterattack, their civilians suffer, but if they do, it's highly likely that Palestinian civilians will suffer significant casualties, leading to condemnation of Israel. The situation is complex because many Palestinians feel they are being confined and controlled by an entity that does not truly want them there, leading Palestinian groups to resort to militancy out of desperation. However, when examining the history of this conflict, it feels like a question of what came first, the chicken or the egg? This situation is a human-made paradox. I do not know how this will be resolved, but it will require a completely new mindset and framework. If anyone could shed some light please feel free.

Logically this can't be true. You can't destroy a movement with military force. You can't solve a political problem with military force. The western world keeps making this same mistake. 

No where in the sub do I see reasonable arguments justifying the amount of bombing and destruction. Have you seen the amount of buildings that have been destroyed? It will take so many years to repair this. Don't you think the son who's dad got blown up might pick up a gun. Don't you think the dad who's son got crushed might now be less moderate? The families that are now condemned to be essentially homeless for a long time will get angry. The solution isn't more punishment.

If ceasefire gets back the hostages, then the war should end. The death toll is too high. The stories of famine and extreme poverty are real. To ignore this is irresponsible.

The argument I see is if we stop we won't have destroyed Hamas. By this logic the war will never stop. You can't destroy Hamas. Even if you try Hamas 2.0 or Hezbollah will attack if the status quo is maintained. The only solution to a political problem is politics. A measured compromise. A compromise that must address the illegal settlements, which addresses Israel's security concerns and which allows more freedoms for Palestinians in Gaza and the west bank. I don't want to be told they rejected this deal etc etc. If this isn't the solution there is no solution and war will never end, ever. 

Bibi has to carry on fighting, if he doesn't his government falls apart. Bibi is being propped up by a group that wants war and wants to absorb Palestine into israel, if Bibi stops the war they pull out. If his government fails he's screwed and faces possible charges. For me it feels like one man's personal struggle is partly shaping the direction of war, which is insane.

I understand the hurt the Israeli people are feeling. What I can't understand is how the Israeli public can't see that even if the war is justified the safety of Israel is being compromised. This war will increase the chance of other groups attacking. This war will create a generation of poverty stricken Palestinians who will become radicalised. The safety of Israeli citizens is being played with by a man who only cares about himself. 

What I want to hear are reasonable arguments on how this war can achieve meaningful objectives that result in a safer Israel. In my opinion killing a certain amount of Hamas fighters doesn't stop the next generation picking up a gun. Killing Hamas fighters doesn't stop the rest of Israel's enemies. What stops Israel's enemies is Israel showing to the world that it will work with it's neighbours and ensure they are listened to. If Israel removes settlers and helps bring about a two state solution, this will bring a more sustained peace than the temporary peace after a failed war.

Neither side of the war is showing any kind of humanity. As ever it's normal people that suffer. Especially women, children and the poor.

Israel could show it's humanity and extend peaceful support to all of the innocent civilians caught up in this shit show but it doesn't. Why not? Because Israel hates all Palestinians. 

Israel could easily show some morality by opening up it's border to refugees and with it gain a huge advantage over Hamas in the media battle and gain world support by showing its only after Hamas and not the annihilation of the people of Gaza. But it doesn't. Why not?

Hamas could show it's humanity by giving up all remaining hostages and show solidarity, promote a more liberal government of Gaza and enhance itshope of survival. But it does not. Why not? 

Peace in the West Bank would help too but Israel seems hell bent on squeezing Arabs out of there.

It's all a shit show and anyone who says their war machine is morally superior is just lying through their teeth.

Only support for refugees, hostages and prisoners (especially children) who have not committed crimes is morally just.

So why am I, and Israeli citizen and apparently Zionist (never really felt like I was until this war) actually writing about this guy? By all convention these days this guy should be my enemy, right? He is vehemently pro Palestinian and must therefore hate Israel’s existence. And he did. But he also critically viewed his side of the argument and found that he did not like what he saw. In fact, he says that for the most part the pro Palestinian cause in the West is actually detrimental to the Palestinian people themselves. For example, in his article he writes that he advocated for an international airstrip in Gaza. He even got ahead in negotiations with Israeli seniors and Palestinian leaders. This could have been the start of a normalisation process as it would have given Palestinians a way out of the blockades of Gaza. Need I remind you, this is a Palestinian writing this! So no one can say it’s just Israeli propaganda….anyway, who were the ones critical of this plan? The pro pali activists, who said that it would defeat their ultimate purpose of destroying Israel’s image, as it would portray them in too good a light for giving Palestinians their freedom. This guy portrays the sheer devastation that is happening in Gaza, but is accusing the right people for that devastation,i.e both sides.

This guy, like the majority of Israelis, hate the ruling government of Israel, but also openly hate Hamas, and is outwardly advocating for a long term two state solution. If more pro Palestinians would see things the way he does I believe we could all actually become friends! We need leadership on both sides that sees the potential for peace, not war.

This led many Jews to be emotional about Zionism. We’ve always prayed “We are in the West, but our hearts are in the East” and “Next year in Jerusalem”, to beg G-D for the arrival of Messiah. Important to say, almos any rabbi of the 19th century opposed Zionism: Judaism prescribes that only the Messiah can end this exile, and that the return to Zion will not be “like climbing a wall of glass” (As the Talmud says, so it won’t be something difficult but the whole world will accept it).",Why so many jews fell for Zionism.,0.73,68,0,2023-11-18 17:15:57

They have gotten close to outright denying the Holocaust: “Al Jazeera has sought to cast doubt upon the Nazi genocide of the Jewish people and millions of others, referring to it in a May 23 news story as “the alleged Holocaust.””

“Al Jazeera also routinely glorifies violence against Israeli Jews, regularly calling Palestinians killed in the act of trying to murder Israelis as “martyrs.” The network also uses this term for any Palestinian operative of the armed wing of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad who is killed by Israeli forces, despite the fact that both of these groups avowedly seek to slaughter Israeli civilians. Al Jazeera also still refers to these groups as “the resistance” and to members of their armed wings as “resisters.””

Also, they have cited KNOWN fake death tolls provided by Hamas for women and children in Gaza. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-69014893.amp)

This is because Israel has done so much for human life and the wars are alienating Israel. 

**Climate Awareness and Medical research:**

Israel truthfully is the most humane country in the Middle East. Israel is ranked 24th in the Global Sustainability Index, reflecting its efforts in maintaining a relatively low-carbon economy and commitment to reducing per capita emissions. They are a world leader in medical research, making amazing breakthroughs in cancer treatment. As for the climate Israeli citizens are very conscious. They recycle ninety percent of their water waste, higher than any other country in the world. Ninety percent of Israeli households get their hot water from solar heaters on the top of their house. Israel developed drip irrigation technology, saving up to 50% of water usage in agriculture and increasing global crop yields. Between 2016 and 2022, Israel's climate technology sector expanded by 60%, encompassing over 850 companies dedicated to sustainable solutions. Israel has implemented afforestation projects and rangeland management to combat desertification, prevent soil erosion, and enhance biodiversity. Israel provides universal health care and ranks among the top countries for healthcare system performance. Israeli scientists developed the first fully computerized, no-radiation, diagnostic instrumentation for breast cancer. Israel is the only country to have revived a dead language, making Hebrew its national language.

**Overall Economic success:**

Israel is known as a startup nation, this is because they have the highest concentration of hi- tech companies in the world other than silicon valley. Israel has the highest rate of people with university degrees per capita in the world, which means they also have the highest number of engineers and scientists per capita in the world. They are ranked fourth in the world for the highest number of startups valued over a billion dollars. Israel spends the highest percent of their GDP on research and development out of every country in the world

**Misc:**

Israel is ranked the fifth happiest country in the world even in their war according to the World Happiness Report 2024.Per capita Israel takes in the most immigrants and donates the most kidneys in the world. 22% of all Nobel prize winners are Jewish. They have one of the lowest unemployment rates out of all developed nations. Israel publishes more books per capita than any other country. Israel has more museums per capita than any other country in the world. Israel is approximately the size of New Jersey, fitting into the geography of the United States 463 times and into the state of Texas 33 times.

Note I don't support everything Israel does. But it is undeniable that without October 7th this war would not be going on. Also if Hamas did not take hostages and hide in tunnels strategically under hospitals, schools, and mosques there would be less deaths. It is important to note that the civilian to combatant ratio in this war is relatively low for urban combat, if this is a genocide then most of all wars are genocides. The Palestinian population I believe has increased this year.

Since we have testimony from a doctor stating children are being sniped you believe he’s lying just because. I presume a doctor in Gaza has more knowledge of the situation on the ground than you, but clearly you believe otherwise.

For good measure, here’s a video of the IDF sniping a grandma waving a white flag holding the hand of her 5 year old grandson [link](https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2024/01/25/palestinians-gaza-shooting-investigation-ward-intl-ldn-vpx.cnn)

Guessing your next reply will be something along the lines of “see they didn’t shoot the child.” I’d say the IDF having no moral qualms about shooting this grandma makes it very apparent they have no remorse about shooting a child either. And a Jewish surgeon treating children with bullet wounds checks out that someone definitively shot them. Feel free to perform whatever mental gymnastics you need to justify these attrocities and this continuous cycle of denial. Hope someday you find your humanity ✌️

He is speaking to Pro-Palestinian who got confused when he tried to explain to him that he is Arab Israeli. I think the Pro-Palestinian got confused when he realized that not every Israeli are Jews, there are Arabs living in Israel too. Part of the conversation is in Arabic, English subtitles provided. Marwan speaks fluent Arabic. Not in this video, but Marwan explains he spoke to many Arabs from around the world and they mistakenly thought there are no Arabs in Israel, they mistakenly thought everyone in Israel are Jews, and mistakenly thought all the Arabs were expelled during the Nakba.

Video 2 https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDSK_H4owdx/

The girl is an Israeli Jew interviewing Marwan. Marwan explains he is not Palestinian. Marwan explains he is an Arab Israeli. They discuss about the Nakba. He doesnt think Israel is an apartheid. 

What he didnt specifically mention in this video is he is a Druze Arab Israeli. Druze speaks Arabic. They are not Muslim, their religion is Druze. While everything they talked in the video is correct and accurate in my opinion, like they say, the devil is in the details. To the uninformed, those people who fell into the trap and see the Israel-Palestinian conflict as a dichotomy (either or, in absolute terms), thats where they get many things wrong. This conflict is very complicated and there are many nuances. 

Video 3 : https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8Mpphwq5Uc/

Marwan introduces himself as a Druze Arab Israeli. He explains that because Israeli Jews dont speak Arabic, the message to the Arab world has been monopolized by one side. Hence, he feels the responsibility to explain the truth and set the record straight in the Arab world using the Arabic language lies with the Arab Israeli. He was just 15 years old when he made that video. 

P/s: most of the videos you see of him mentioned he is 15 years old, but he just turn 16 two days ago. ","Meet Marwan, a 16 year old Arab Israeli who has a message to the world, dont believe everything you see and hear on social media to true",0.78,113,0,2024-12-18 13:45:49

m9qoref,1,The claim that the population distribution in Jerusalem was representative of the wider country.,IsraelPalestine,2025-01-29 00:55:13,1ic6pvr,Tallis-man,0,1,0,True,2012-09-07 14:31:37,12.0,0.0,11872.0,77192.0,89076.0,54,"On the 15th of December 2024, the [Prime Minister of Ireland stated](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/413c5-statement-from-taoiseach-simon-harris/):

&gt; ""I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.

Is this statement true? **Does Ireland consistently uphold international law equally for all nations, or does Israel face a different standard of scrutiny?**

Let's now examine how Ireland's actions towards Israel compare to its responses to similar situations involving other countries in recent decades:

**(1)** The [Irish request to the ICJ for the broadening of the interpretation of the definition of genocide](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ireland-government-israel-micheal-martin-myanmar-b2662599.html) in the Myanmar and Israel cases was submitted this December 2024. The Irish government have been [aware of the Myanmar case](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/205031) since its very beginning in 2019, and have been actively involved in it at least since 2022. Why did Ireland request this reinterpretation of the definition of genocide only now? Is the Myanmar case so clear-cut and dry that the broadening of the interpretation was not required, and only Israel's case requires it? If so, then does this mean that the reinterpretation request was submitted **specifically** for Israel's case? Otherwise, if the request was not requested *specifically* for Israel's case but also for Myanmar's, then why the multiple year wait until it happened? 6 years is a long time, did anything new come up in the Myanmar case recently to demand this request for the broadening of the interpretation of the definition of genocide? Did Ireland only just think of it right now, this December? It seems to be quite the coincidence, if so. More over - Ireland has intervened in the [Ukraine vs. Russia](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ireland-government-israel-micheal-martin-myanmar-b2662599.html) genocide case in 2022, and did not then or since have requested this broadening of the interpretation of the definition of genocide. How come? Why not then? If it is not related specifically to Israel, then, *why now?*

**(2)** Ireland's parliament has [passed a motion declaring that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/irish-parliament-passes-motion-declaring-israel-is-perpetrating-genocide-in-gaza/3387734). This was before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had even [received the evidence in the South Africa vs Israel case](https://www.timesofisrael.com/south-africa-files-its-evidence-of-alleged-israeli-genocide-in-gaza-at-un-court/), not to even mention hold the trial or announce a final verdict - as this will be in many years (probably around 2027-2028). It is a very remarkable things, that Ireland has done - a thing that no other country has done in regards to Israel's ICJ case, or in regards to the Israel-Hamas war. Not even South Africa has done this. This raises the question of why Ireland has not done this (i.e. passing a parliamentary motion declaring that some country has committed genocide) for Myanmar, for Russia, etc - in the cases of which Ireland is also involved. Why the distinction between Israel and the rest?
Perhaps Ireland's intent, with this motion about Israeli genocide, was to affect significant change in the Israel-Hamas war, or in their view - to ""stop a genocide""? If so, why not do the same for Sudan, where a war taking place is also [being called a genocide](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/africa/sudan-genocide-explained/index.html) by many, [including in Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorials/2024/10/09/the-irish-times-view-on-the-war-in-sudan-the-forgotten-war-taking-a-terrible-toll/)? Is the Sudan war not significant enough or important enough to attempt to try and stop it with a motion of the Irish parliament? Again, it does seem a bit peculiar that only Israel has had a motion declaring it is committing genocide, and not Myanmar or Sudan, or Russia or any other place where Ireland believes a genocide is occurring.

**(3)** Speaking of motions declaring that genocide is being committed, did Ireland ever pass a similar motion declaring any other nation or non-State actor of committing genocide in the past? Perhaps Syria, Sudan, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Congo, Darfur, China, Yemen, Azerbaijan, Russia, ISIS? The situation in Gaza is horrific, there is no doubt, but it is also true that in most of these other terrible situations, the amount of the dead is an order of magnitude higher (10-100 times the amount of dead civilians - 3 million in Congo, half a million in Syria, 300k in Darfur, 400k in Yemen, etc). Some of these situations have had a clear as day intent for genocide (e.g. Darfur, China). Why is it that Ireland has never passed any such motion, ever? What extraordinary circumstances with the case of Israel are enough for it to be the only country in the history of Ireland to warrant such a parliamentary motion?

**(4)** Lastly, why has Ireland not passed a motion declaring that Hamas committed genocide on October 7, which had been declared to be a genocide by [Genocide Watch](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/holocaust-genocide-scholars-condemn-oct-7-hamas-massacre) and by an [ICC Prosecutor](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-10-23/luis-moreno-ocampo-ex-icc-prosecutor-to-not-allow-water-food-and-fuel-through-is-to-turn-all-of-gaza-into-an-extermination-camp.html) (which said: ""what happened on October 7 was genocide because Hamas’s intention is to destroy the Israeli people"")? Does the Irish parliament think that October 7 has not yet been proven as a genocide, and so not yet worthy of such a motion? Or rather, that it has been conclusively proven to **not** be a genocide? It would be interesting to understand the difference between the two situations, as it seems like the bar of sufficient evidence is different for the Israel and Hamas cases. 
Maybe this is not the reason however, perhaps Ireland only recognizes as genocide the situations that are *""ongoing""* genocides, so recognizing the October 7 massacre as a genocide is not the modus operandi of Ireland, as it happened more than a year ago. (""Old news"".) This would be consistent somewhat with past Irish choices, for example [Ireland does not recognize the Armenian massacre as a genocide](https://gript.ie/tanaiste-wont-commit-to-recognising-the-armenian-genocide/), though it has been debated within Ireland many many times. So this could make sense - as policy, perhaps Ireland simply does not recognize *non-ongoing* genocides. But this again brings up the question of the many decades of Ireland not declaring any other ongoing situation as a genocide, in real-time - when they were ongoing, e.g. not doing it for October 7 when it was occurring, not doing it for Sudan nowadays. Israel is the first, and only, country to be handled by Ireland in this way.

**To summarize:**

 * Ireland requested a broader definition of genocide in the ICJ case against Israel but not Myanmar or Russia.
 * Ireland's parliament declared Israel's actions in Gaza a genocide before any ICJ verdict, unlike their approach to all other conflicts.
 * The parliamentary motion for Israel declaring genocide is unique compared to Ireland's inaction on similar situations like Sudan.
 * Ireland hasn't passed a parliamentary motion for Hamas declaring October 7 a genocide, nor has it ever for any other genocide - while it was happening.

All of these points together can hint at a unique approach towards Israel. Ireland's actions concerning Israel deviate significantly from its responses to other global crises.

This bring us back to the Irish Prime Minister's quote:

&gt; ""I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.

On the contrary, do we see a single Jewish student at any university in Palestine or Lebanon or Syria or Jordan? Even in the University of Ariel, which the “enlightened” EU seems to boycott, there are Arab students and even a mosque!

Imagine if you had accepted Trump’s Vision for Peace offer. So what if you lost a bit of land, Gaza would be a thriving industrial zone, way better than it is now. Jenin powerful plant could have been running full steam. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans would be working in Israel. Imagine how many more Palestinian students would be studying in Haifa, Tel Aviv, and the Hebrew University by now.

Imagine what Gaza would have been if you just focused on building it after the 2005 disengagement. You wouldn’t have to pay for any defence or military, you could have just focused on developing the greenhouses and other civilian infrastructure like the Japanese did and shown the world what you are capable of. Gazans would have been working in Israel and traveling to Jerusalem with ease by now.

Imagine if you had just taken the Barak offered deal in 2000. So what if it was 97% of West Bank and not 100! Palestine would have been a much more prosperous state with an airport in Gaza. University of Haifa and other ones in Israel would have so many students and faculty, considered “Palestinian universities”. I won't even bother getting into what Palestine could have been if the leaders just accepted the partition plan that gave them most of the fertile land.

Same goes to Lebanon, you folks have no territorial disputes with Israel and could open relations tomorrow and enjoy visiting Haifa, an hour away! Oh come on, Shebaa farms? Is that small strip of uninhabited land worth thousands of lives and a destroyed country? Half of your own politicians don’t think Shebaa farms is yours.

If Lebanon and Palestine made peace, the Levant could have been like the Schengen, a strong economic zone with people from all ethnicities coexisting and prospering. Instead, you threw it all away, the next generations shouldn’t never forgive you. 

Word of advice, dear Palestinians: The next time if Israel offers any deal, just take it, take it! Swallow your pride, take it. Lay down your arms, start working with the Jews who have always been open and continue to be in places like University of Haifa. Sit down, think of what the future can be if you stopped continuing on the path of attempted destruction of the Jews, that would help you swallow your pride.

I am very much of the belief that anti-Zionism is antisemitism. For all the people who believe the state of Israel should be abolished, what do you think will realistically happen to the Jews?

They are certainly not safe in North America where many Jewish people are afraid of telling others that they are Jewish. Jewish businesses, school, neighborhoods, community centers and synagogues are threatened, vandalized and boycotted more than any other religious group in the country. Most of my Jewish friends are not comfortable letting strangers know they are Jewish or have any sort of connection to Israel.

Europe is also extremely antisemitic and I don't blame any folks of European Jewish decent for not wanting to return there after the horrible things that happened to their families.

Jews in Africa have been getting slaughtered for decades and nobody talks about it. 94% of African Jews have fled to Israel to escape discrimination. South America also has a long history of oppressing Jews. And don't even get me started on the Middle East. Not to mention, after Israel's hypothetical demise, the Arab countries would only be harder on the Jews than they already are after the past 80 years of conflict.

Looking back on history, it is very clear that every region of the world has been horrible to these people. So how do you justify the destruction of the only Jewish state as anything but anti-Jew? Try to take the Palestinians out of the equation for a moment and ask yourself: **If Israel is abolished, do you not care about what a massive impact it would have on the lives of Jews around the world?**

To be clear, this isn't about the Israeli government, the war in Gaza, Hamas, etc. This is about advocating for the erasure of Jewish independence on a global scale. There are over 7,000,000 Jews living in Israel. Imagine forcing them to disperse into countries that do not want them AGAIN. Would you look at that and be happy you got what you wanted?

me891hb,23,"Stockholm Syndrome was coined after a hostage situation in Stockholm. The police handling the situation acted recklessly, endangering the lives of the hostages. Over the days the hostages spent with their captives, they came to the conclusion that the police were a larger threat to them than their captives, and bonded with the captives.

One hostage told the Prime Minister of Sweden at the time, that she trusted her captors and were more scared that she would die by the police in an assault on the building. 

After release, the hostages refused to testify against their captive, and even began raising money in his defence.

After the situation was dealt with, the hostages weren’t willing to cooperate with the men that endangered their lives, so the police got a psychiatrist by the name of Nils Bejerot to share some understanding. Without talking to the hostages, Bejerot termed Stockholm Syndrome.

Some of those were amplified by concerned voices who perceived these statements to be genocidal in nature. As with everything, it pays to take a closer look and understand the context. It also pays for Israeli leaders to choose their words carefully, as they will be misinterpreted in the worst ways possible.

To be clear, I'm sure that there are some Israelis (hopefully a minority) who would be happy to call for Palestinian genocide. But the following well-beaten quotes are not one of those.

# ""The emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy"":

Sounds like the IDF was announcing that it will officially be committing indiscriminate bombing (a war crime).

The original source I found for this statement is a report from Haaretz in Hebrew, which notably has edited the relevant words, ""הדגש הוא על נזק ולא על דיוק"", out of the original report (compare [this screenshot](https://twitter.com/MacaesBruno/status/1711714461034119377/photo/1), 2nd paragraph line 2, to [the current version](https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2023-10-10/ty-article-live/0000018b-1645-d465-abbb-16f71d060000#1720386730)).

In English language reporting on this statement, The Guardian recently made an important correction to [their article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/right-now-it-is-one-day-at-a-time-life-on-israels-frontline-with-gaza) that sheds more light:

&gt;The headline and text of this article were amended on 5 December 2023. An earlier version used a **mistranslated quote** of R Adm Daniel Hagari saying “hundreds of tonnes of bombs” had already been dropped on Gaza and that “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy”. In fact, he said “thousands of tonnes of munitions” had been dropped and **“while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage”**.

*So, what's the difference?* The original mistranslated quote could easily be interpreted as saying ""we don't care about hitting Hamas targets, we care about causing damage in Gaza"". The corrected translation speaks to those who know a thing or two about the laws of war - IHL, that require the acting army to weigh the pros and cons of each strike and methods employed, to balance between military gain vs collateral damage. Within the range of justifiable and legal military responses, there is a choice between minimum acceptable damage to maximum acceptable damage, which directly affects minimum acceptable collateral risk to maximum acceptable collateral risk. In the past, Israel has often focused on surgical strikes, which is on the minimum side of the range. However this time, as Israel faced a bigger threat, the military necessity of a more forceful response was obvious, hence the shift to maximum, but still within IHL.

This understanding fits with [other statements he made](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/11/israel-abandon-precision-bombing-eliminate-hamas-officials/#:~:text=The%20top%20priority%20in%20the%20attacks%20is%20to%20eliminate%20senior%20%5BHamas%5D%20officials) at the same time, ""The top priority in the attacks is to eliminate senior \[Hamas\] officials"", and statements made by IDF officials at that time, ""There are no surgical strikes"" and that ""the concept of 'knock on the roof' is not relevant to this operation"", emphasizing that nevertheless, the strikes are still professional and precise. - [Mako news](https://www.mako.co.il/news-military/6361323ddea5a810/Article-c10c386058d1b81027.htm)

**TLDR:** The original quote is not accurate. The actual quote, translated correctly, is: “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage”. Which means that within the range of legal strikes the IDF can make, they are on the maximum setting, unlike previous Gaza operations, which have been relatively more reserved. It does not mean that the IDF is announcing they will be doing indiscriminate bombing.

# Netanyahu said that ""you must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible.""

**EDIT:** I have made [a separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18nxyyb/opinion_referencing_amalek_is_not_a_call_to) to clarify this one.

# [Israel's Minister of Communications calls on the IDF to remove the foreskins of Hamas fighters as David did in the Tanakh](https://twitter.com/shlomo_karhi/status/1725504217148797065?t=fQCjeexEmpM1ier00jAPIw&amp;s=19)

Again, this is based on bad translation (to be fair, even a native Israeli could misunderstand this). The most obvious flag that the above is a bad interpretation is the fact that Muslims, and by extension Hamas fighters, are already circumcised.

Many words in Hebrew have multiple meanings or can reference different concepts, depending on the context, suffix or prefix. ""Orla"" means a blockage or impediment. When referring to the penis, it means the foreskin. When referring to the heart, it means a spiritual blockage. When referring to produce, it means produce that a Jew is blocked/prohibited from consuming. When referring to the lips, it means a speech impediment (Moses described himself this way ""va'ani aral sefataim""). When referring to a human (""Arel""), it generally means a non-Jew man (or woman - ""Arela"") regardless of the status of their foreskin, as they are not commanded by the Torah to circumcise, or literally an uncircumcised male Jew.

The word in question is in paragraph 3, ערלות, can be read as A) ""orlot"", meaning foreskins of, or B) as ""areloot"", meaning the blockage/impediment of, or C) ""arelot"", meaning non Jewish women. In the context in his tweet, the middle reading fits best, so that sentence should be translated as the following:

&gt;Our fighters, who went to war for the house (homeland) and to avenge the terrible massacre carried out by the Nazi terrorists, will cover them in their tunnels with dirt, and will return to peace with the abductees, with the help of G-d, only after they have cut down **the impediment** of these cursed ones.

I hope this will serve as a reality check to the people claiming that for example it “wasn’t worth” to pull the operation that brought 4 live hostages home because “innocent civilians” that just happened to hold said hostages in their homes got killed in the process, this is just a glimpse of how these monsters treat the people they took, no price the enemy will pay is too high to get them back.

lyzpjna,3,The one with their head in the sand is you. I wish just for an instant someone like you could open their eyes. I know this falls on deaf ears but I’d love to meet your parents and start to understanding how people like you are made.,IsraelPalestine,2024-11-25 23:51:46,1gyuwrx,Legitimate-Reach7427,0,3,0,True,2020-12-12 01:28:42,0.0,0.0,43.0,470.0,513.0,122,"I am sure we have all heard claims of genocide in Gaza. Man of these claims are coming from tik tok (which is controlled by the Chinese government who promotes anti-Israel content) or highly biased news sources like Al-Jazeera (which is controlled by Qatari government who promotes anti-Israel content), or Wikipedia (anti-Israeli moderates have changed countless pages over the last year to ‘rewrite history’ via Wikipedia to be anti-Israel). 

The word “genocide” does not mean ‘alot of people were killed’. It means ‘destruction of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, either in whole or in part.’ Israel had withdrawn from Gaza in 2006 and allowed elections, why would that be the case if the intention was to kill all Palestinians? Israel invaded Gaza again after October 7th - as any country would have in response to the biggest terrorist attack in modern history. (Imagine after 9/11 the asking the US to do nothing I protect itself from further attacks by Osama bin Laden - that's roughly the equivalent of that you're asking Israel to do by not defending itself against Hamas.) 

Meanwhile Hamas very intentionally hides among Palestinian civilians so that any attempt to kill terrorists causes as much loss of civilians as possible- and Hamas wants this, not Israel. There is a number called civilian to combatant ratio - essentially, how many civilians have been killed in order to kill one combatant (in this case Hamas terrorist). The global numbers for modern urban warfare such as when the US from operating in Mosul range that I recall range anywhere from 9:1 to 4:1 (somewhere between 4-9 civilians killed for every one combatant), the estimates (even if you believe Hamas's reported numbers which you shouldn't because they change them - and the UN has acknowledged this) in Gaza are less than 2 civilians to 1 combatant- meaning that Israel has killed fewer civilians per combatant than ANY similar war in modern history - the exact opposite of what this number would look like if genocide was the goal. Yet did you hear claims of the US committing genocide in Mosul? Of course not, so how is that Israel is committing genocide if the ratio is less so much better? It doesn't stand to reason, unless you acknowledge that these claims are not based in facts but biased accusations made by sources whose goal is to hurt Israel. Lastly when there is a genocide, the population total drops dramatically. For instance after the Holocaust the total number of Jews in the world decreased from around 15 million to around 9 million (today there are still only around 15 million Jews in the world). The population of Palestinians continues to rise, even despite the terrible loss of life (30 thousand plus) that has occurred. There very simply cannot be a genocide where the total population does not make a huge decrease. This very simply has not occurred. I've heard people say, well if Israel 'could get away with it' they would commit genocide but the world 'won't let them get away with it' - I disagree but even within this those people are unintentionally acknowledging that Israel has NOT committed a genocide at this point in time. I'm not here to argue what Israel would-would not do 'if it could get away with it' that is conjecture. I'm here to say that in the real world in which we life, no genocide has occurred in Gaza. Some may legitimately misunderstand the very confusing ruling given by Court of International Justice about whether or not there has been a genocide in Gaza. There is a lot of confusing ""legal-ease"" wording but what the decision boiled down to was that Israel was NOT found to have committed genocide, instead the court asserted the people of Gaza are protected by law (like everyone in the whole world) from genocide. These are 2 very different things. Here is more information from the former head of this court if you're interested in this:
https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-68906919

There are millions of Palestinians in the West Bank. Why is there no ground invasion and bombing of the West Bank if the goal is to kill all Palestinians? There are millions of Palestinians in the Jordan, why has Israel not attacked Jordan? The answer is the same to all of these questions…it’s that Israel is fighting an incredibly difficult war against Hamas and destroying Hamas is the goal, not genocide. If Israel wanted to commit genocide ie killing all Palestinians - there would be no one left in Gaza, the West Bank or 1/2 of Jordan. There are many civilians being killed in Gaza (as there have been in every major war including World War I and World War II) that doesn’t mean that there’s a genocide. Please educate yourself further on this better by looking at reputable news sources not social media, Wikipedia, obviously biased news sources like Al Jazeera. Falsely accusing Israel, i.e. Jews of committing genocide, isn't attempt to draw a false equivalence between the genocide of the holocaust which the Jew suffered and what's happening in Gaza. Essentially to say, hey world 'you don't have to feel bad for Jews and what happened in the holocaust anymore because they're doing it to somebody else and therefore, it has evened out. You can go back to hating and attacking Jews without feeling bad for them or that you need to protect them as victims of the holocaust.""

Before you tell me to 'get educated' and post a link to a Al Jazeera know that I've done extensive research into the topic. I have taken classes at on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which included writing a proposal for what a peace agreement might look like between Israel and a Palestinian state, as well as written papers regarding the legal status of Palestinians according to international law in Gaza and the West Bank. I've lived in Israel. I am a Doctor who cared for Palestinian children with cancer. Through this education and experience I had many of preconceived ideas of what I had been taught by my family and the news changed. I highly recommend everyone considers doing so (not just scrolling on your phone and thinking you have the right to tell others to get 'educated'.) I am pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian and pro-peace and yes you can be all of the above, especially if you believe like I do a long term peace agreement in the context of a 2 state solution (which is what Ehud Barak offered to Yassir Arafat in 2000 which Arafat rejected partially because Hamas did not want it to occur, and partially because Arafat was embezzling billions of dollars and feared he would be not make more money and potentially be assasinnated if he signed it). We are as far away from this as we have ever been but the step towards peace is not a short term ceasefire that leaves Hamas in charge, it is removing Hamas so that a more moderate government that actually cares for the people of Gaza as opposed to stealing aid money from the Palestinian people (the top 3 heads of Hamas and Arafat's family have about $17 BILLION dollars, I wonder where that came from) and using them as human shields while they build terror tunnels for themselves. 

Many of you reading this who, like me, want what's best for the people of Gaza have been led to believe that supporting Hamas and being angry at Israel and as an extension, all Jews throughout the world, will somehow make things better for the people of Gaza. You have been lied to. Even if you hate Israel, please explain how for instance a Rabbi being killed in Dubai today makes life better for the people of Gaza. Explain how yelling at or attacking Jews on the street in your local town- or being silent while others do it- helps the people of Gaza. I am asking you to not triple down on your bias but instead please explore the following (if you're right and I'm wrong you should be able to listen to the other side of the argument without fear of having your mind changed, right?). Unfortunately there is no such thing as 'unbiased' news sources (some are pro-Israel, most are pro-Palestinian) but I have found BBC to be better than most (though even then it leans anti-Israel).

The story goes that the reason the Romans wanted to spite the Jews was that they were stubbornly revolting. So the name was erased (and a more generic one replaced it) to further severe the Jews' connection to the land. Any name would have had the same effect, but Philistine might have just been the obvious choice, considering what you said.

No country known as ""Palestine"" has ever existed, so a starting point is to recognize that the people we consider ""Palestinians"" today are really just refugees who are the descendants of those who rejected the 1947 UN partition plan and lost the Arab-Israeli war. That is the reality. It is a fantasy that a country known as ""Palestine"" ever existed. Prior to the British controlling the region it was the Ottomans. Prior to that it was the Romans and other Europeans. There was never actually an independent country known as ""Palestine"". 

There are four criteria for a country to exist based on the 1933 Montevideo convention that is recognized as the standard for statehood by international law (I highlight in the video that the UN doesn't recognize statehood and other countries recognizing a state doesn't meet the requirements laid out by the convention). 

1. You need a permanent population, which the ""Palestinians"" do not have and they admit most ""Palestinians"" are refugees. 

2. You need a clearly defined territory, but as we look at history, they rejected the 1947 partition plan to actually have a clearly defined territory. 

3. You need a government. I highlight how a sovereign government has never existed. 

4. You need the ability to enter relations with other states, which MIGHT be the only requirement they meet out of the 4, but I highlight how that is even questionable. 

Based on these criteria, no state known as ""Palestine"" has ever existed and I don't see how this situation is any different from Biafra in Nigeria (the movement is ironically being ran in Biafra by a Jew who is under persecution who highlights that Jews need a state due to persecution no matter where we are). I hope the video is informative and I accept any pushback, but the conclusion is that no such country as ""Palestine"" has ever existed and the protestors to ""free Palestine"" are highly misinformed.

I hope this will serve as a reality check to the people claiming that for example it “wasn’t worth” to pull the operation that brought 4 live hostages home because “innocent civilians” that just happened to hold said hostages in their homes got killed in the process, this is just a glimpse of how these monsters treat the people they took, no price the enemy will pay is too high to get them back.

Frankly I got tired of arguing with people that try any possible way to excuse them and say Israel is not “proportional”, there is no reaction too big after what happened on Oct 7th, as long as they will learn the lesson that pulling stuff like this will cost a great great price, just looking at this video fills me with rage and takes me back to Oct 7th, listening to helpless civilians getting killed live on the phone with news outlets, they were overjoyed hurting people that couldn’t defend themselves, and now cry and whine when people who can fight are fighting back, I have lost my ability to feel sympathy towards them, I just want that what ever brings the hostages back, and makes sure no one will dare to attempt to attack us again,  will be done.","Video of Hamas terrorists kidnapping and abusing Or Cohen, Eliya Cohen and Hirsh Goldenberg",0.79,144,0,2024-06-24 16:49:56

Many Jews have been living in Palestine for generations, and the Arabs got mad because they were buying land sold by Arabs at a high and unfair price. This somehow angered the Palestinian Arabs and started the violence against Jews.

1921 Jaffa massacre

Black hand massacres against Jews

1929 Hevron Jew massacre

1929 Palestine riots

1936-1939 Palestine uprising against Jews and UK

1938 Tiberias Massacre

And many more

This resulted in UK issuing the 1939 White Paper policy in response to the Jewish violence committed by the Arabs. It ensured the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine as a way to protect them from Arabs. This paper was then referred to the United Nations and was modified in order to create a separate state of Israel. The Jewish majority neighborhoods would then be separated and will form the nation of Israel which was a very small percentage of the total land of Palestine

So the Palestinians technically created their own demise by persecuting and committing violence against Jews merely for migrating and purchasing land from Palestinian land owners at an unfair price. 

Their persecutions of us Jews led to the creation of Israel.

Where is that line for you, if you don't think they've crossed it yet?

What statements and/or atrocities would you need to see before you'd consider calling it genocide? Is there a point at which, in your opinion, it could be genocide, or do you think that the killing of every Palestinian would still not be genocide?

I ask this because the arguments I've seen against calling what's happening in Gaza a genocide have gotten a lot worse than they were in September. People who say things like ""the Palestinians aren't a people, so it can't be genocide"", ""no matter how many people they kill, genocide is about intent, not the number of deaths"" (this might make sense if we were just talking about combatants, but we're not), or ""they're just lying about the number of deaths, and they can't be trusted to tell the truth about what's happening to them"" are saying the kinds of things people have always said to cover up genocide.

Denying the existence of the people you're accusing of committing genocide against is a classic way to deny an active genocide. So is saying they can't be trusted to tell the world what's happening to them. Claiming that the destruction of a large portion of an ethnic group is a convenient way to achieve a legitimate military objective is a bit more complicated, but that sounds more like an excuse for genocide than an actual denial, and I don't think there are any excuses for genocide.

I believe that killing everyone in Gaza, or a significant portion of the population of Gaza, would be genocide. I would consider doing something that a reasonable person would believe would result in the death of a large portion of an ethnic group to be genocide or attempted genocide, and advocating such an overt act is advocating genocide. The people who call for things like ""leveling Gaza,"" knowing that Palestinian civilians have no way to leave and that such a small area could only support a small fraction of the existing population without urban infrastructure, are calling for genocide.

What do you think they would have to do before it could be called genocide? What would you do if you thought the Israeli government was committing genocide?

Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not asking if Israel is currently committing genocide, that's an argument people have had many times on this forum.

I'm asking what they would have to do for you to consider it genocide.

What baffles me is that people are claiming that Israel is intentionally committing genocide and deliberately targeting civilians in Gaza with bombs. If that is so, then how come the casualties are not even reaching hundreds of thousands?

In WW2 during the Allied bombing of Dresden, the Allies dropped **1,400 tons of bombs** in the City of Dresden who had **multiple bomb shelters**. In just a **few days,** **50,000 civilians died** as a result of bombing. Isn't that by definition according to Pro-Palestinians as real genocide? 

The bombing of Dresden pales compare to the bombing of Gaza today and yet Gaza is apparently the best one to appropriately label as genocide. 

This also showcases that Israel is not deliberately targeting civilians with bombings and is careful with their operations. They managed to have casualties lower than **50,000** in a city with no bomb shelters. 

HAMAS is basically trying to maximize the casualties of war **by refusing to build a single bomb shelter in Gaza** since they came to power in 2005. They even commit the **warcrime of Perfidy** by refusing to wear their uniforms in order to blend in with civilians so that Israeli soldiers can accidentally kill innocent ones. Some may argue that they are Militias and that they can fight in civilian clothes. But that's wrong because Militias need to have bandanas or armbands that signifies their side if they're fighting in Civilian clothes just like Ukrainian Militias in Russo-Ukraine war. If you can see in Live battle footages of Gaza, the Palestinian soldiers look indistinguishable from normal civilians in Gaza.

Despite HAMAS trying to maximize the casualties for Internet updoots, Israel is doing a pretty good job of keeping it minimal.

TLDR: Israel has been bombing Gaza, a city without bomb shelters for 6 months, and has achieved lower casualties than the Bombing of German City Dresden who have multiple bomb shelters but more casualties in just a few days. HAMAS has been trying to maximize casualties in order to paint Israel as genocidal and has been deliberately committing war crimes.

kd86ode,1,"..I hate to tell you : your  alleged quotes are fictious .

Modern sources who cite it  are predominantly  , if not entirely ,  polemics strongly prejudiced towards Israeli-Jews  .

No source ; newspapers and books alike ,  prior to 1969 , or contemporary to the 60s-70s  mentions such announcements .

The oldest and first source mentioning them is  "" If Israel Lost the War""  ; an alternate history novel   .. Sadly : the author didn't  provide sources for this quotations  ;  something which is typical 20th century  propaganda .

The verification was done through a search on the Google Books , and the Internet Archive .

&amp;#x200B;

If you and your just as blind  upvoters looked at my references in italics :  you will realise the notion that a military confrontation during the waiting period in  1967 was inevitable  is just a myth .

The Crysis had many factors involved  .. it wasn't a point-blank decision  , rather than an escalating build up of tensions   starting from 1948   , such as water disputes , border skirmishes , and allowing Palestinian fedayeen operations .

The closure of the Tiran Straits wasn't a final straw  .  Israeli-politicians  could have ignored the move   , and sought an alternative area to receive Oil  , on the Mediterranean   , just like back then under British rule where petroleum  was transferred from Mosul to Haifa .

&amp;#x200B;

While one can sense the bold talk of some Arab leaders  of the time : it doesn't mean they committed  to what they say  . Some things are said out of appeasing an excited  public  , rather than expressing actual personal intentions or ideas.

There is a reason why it took weeks  : it's because there could have been negotiations  , with the Tiran straits merely being a pressuring point .

You didn't do much here to refute my point  . 1967  , wasn't a war of desperate survival for Israeli-Jews  ; it was largely a war of choice .   Israeli-Jewish politicians contemporary to the time , later admitted they didn't have full confidence that  Egypt had a dedicated intent to launch an invasion [(1)](https://mondoweiss.net/2015/01/perpetuates-fighting-survival/) .

&amp;#x200B;

Finally for your comments regarding Palestinian refugees :  there is such a thing as property rights , and family reunification  (especially the later  , as around half of Israeli-Arabs have relatives who are Palestinian refugees , such as siblings , parents , childern  , extended families etc )  .

Either the West Bank would need extensive development as to support taking in all those 7 million refugees (Especially compensation for properties ), are instead : a portion of them will have to be absorbed in what is now Israel  on basis of family reunion with Israeli-Arab relatives acting as sponsors .

&amp;#x200B;

As to Mizrahi Israelis : their ""story""  is just a myth .   People who left due to pressure (Not actual expulsion or coercion ) , and barely say anything about where they came from except for public-relations purposes , are not refugees even in the most rudimentary sense  : they are immigrants [(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18ekeg0/old_yishuvpalestinian_jewish_voices_on_the/kcscqsb/?context=3).

Even the founder of one of these organizations claiming Mizrahi grievances  , admitted it only exists just to spite the PLO [(2)](https://prrn.mcgill.ca/research/papers/shenhav.htm) .

\#EDIT :

I double-cheeked again ..Nasser's quote might be genuine (*The 1967 Arab-Israeli War Origins and Consequences*  ; quoting Stephen , 1971 , ""Nasser : a political bibliography"" .) . 

However , here is the full quote  from Shalim's work :

Just find those ""Shock"" phrases , and cut them away from their context and background to support mythology of shallow foundations .",IsraelPalestine,2023-12-13 20:37:12,18gj0qd,Thereturner2023,0,1,0,True,2023-04-10 19:38:26,0.0,0.0,224.0,2751.0,2975.0,212,"After reading some of the responses in the other thread ""Everybody always tells Israel what it shouldn't do , but nobody ever tells them what they should do"" I noticed a lot of replies saying ""return to the 1967 borders"" or ""dismantle the settlements"", as if that would put an end to Hamas and other terrorist groups' attacks on Israel. I find this incredibly naïve and fail to understand how you can come to this conclusion knowing the history of Israel's attempts at creating peace in the region. I've noticed that the pro-Palestinian side will make claims such as Gaza being an ""open-air prison"" Israel is an ""apartheid state"" etc. and when challenged on this and provided with the facts the usual response is, wait no they usually don't reply after that...  


Anyway let's lay down a few of the facts around Gaza:  


\- Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 in an attempt to create peace.

\- 21 Israeli settlements were dismantled in the process, with over 8000 Jews forcefully removed from their homes. Up to October 7th not a single Jew, whether soldier or civilian were living Gaza.

\- Gaza was NOT initially blockaded by Israel, this was a gradual process that was put in place following suicide bombings and other attacks being launched into Israel from Gaza.

\- Since 2005 there have been rocket attacks into Israel every single year from Gaza, with significantly more fired following Hamas rise to power in 2007.

\- Aid sent from around the world to help build Gaza into a prosperous state was diverted into building rockets, digging tunnels and buying luxury homes abroad for Hamas' leadership.

\- Israel had been trying to reduce restrictions, offering thousands of work permits to Gazan civilians, many of which brought back information and layouts of civilian areas to Hamas to help them plan their massacres.  

\- Many of the Israelis living in communities near Gaza were left-wing types who volunteered to help the Palestinians in Gaza, including driving Gazan children to Israeli hospitals. Gazans thanked them by murdering them in their beds.  


So there you have it, Israel literally already did in Gaza what you are telling them to do in the West Bank. The result was 1400 Israelis brutally murdered, raped and kidnapped, with the constant daily threat of rocket attacks. And this is all from one small strip of land, imagine if Israel pulls out of the West Bank, much larger than Gaza and right next to the majority of Israel's main population centres, the threat to its civilians is significantly higher. 

Hamas doesn't govern the West Bank as they do in Gaza, but make no mistake, Hamas is in the WB too along with other equally anti-Semitic terrorist groups, and should Israel pull out of there completely there is no guarantee that a moderate Palestinian polity will take power. 

Gaza was the experiment in what an independent Palestine would look like, and after October 7th how could any Israeli trust that the same thing wouldn't happen on an even larger scale in the West Bank?  
As a non-Israeli, non-Jew I can see that is it is a ridiculous proposition to ask Israelis to put the lives of the majority of their citizens in danger for a fantasy. So why can't you?
