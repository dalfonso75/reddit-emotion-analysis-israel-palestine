# reddit-emotion-analysis-israel-palestine

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the emotional dynamics expressed in Reddit comments related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. By leveraging pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models from Hugging Face, we aim to classify and visualize the predominant emotions in the digital conversation, as well as observe their evolution over time.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Reddit dataset containing user comments.
- Apply a pre-trained NLP model to classify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
- Analyze temporal patterns and trends in the expressed emotions.
- Present the results using clear visualizations and an interactive dashboard.
