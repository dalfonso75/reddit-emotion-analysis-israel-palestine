## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the emotional dynamics expressed in Reddit comments related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. By leveraging pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models from Hugging Face, we aim to classify and visualize the predominant emotions in the digital conversation, as well as observe their evolution over time.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Reddit dataset containing user comments.
- Apply a pre-trained NLP model to classify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
- Analyze temporal patterns and trends in the expressed emotions.
- Present the results using clear visualizations and an interactive dashboard.

## ðŸŽ¯ Selected Variables for Analysis

For the purpose of emotion classification and temporal analysis, we have selected a subset of variables from the dataset that provide meaningful information while preserving the full dataset for potential future exploration. Below is a description of the key variables used:

| **Variable**            | **Reason for Inclusion**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `comment_id`           | Unique identifier for each comment, used to maintain data integrity and avoid duplicates.                   |
| `self_text`            | Main text content of the comment, serving as the input for emotion classification using NLP models.          |
| `created_time`         | Timestamp of the comment, essential for analyzing temporal trends in expressed emotions.                    |
| `subreddit`            | Indicates the community where the comment was posted, useful for comparing emotional patterns across topics. |
| `score`                | Total score of the comment (upvotes minus downvotes), useful to correlate engagement with specific emotions.  |
| `post_title`           | Title of the original post, provides additional context that may influence the emotions expressed in comments. |

---

These selected variables allow us to:
- **Classify emotions** such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
- **Analyze temporal patterns** of expressed emotions.
- **Perform sub-analyses** to understand how engagement (score) and subreddit categories relate to emotional content.

The remaining variables are preserved in the dataset for potential future analyses.
